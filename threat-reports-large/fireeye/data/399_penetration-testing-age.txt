Today it's hard to find an organization that operates without penetration tests.
Thanks to heightened awareness on the part of the management and compliance standards such as PCI DSS, penetration tests are on every CISO's to-do list.
Multiple varieties of penetration tests have emerged, including Black Box, White Box and even Grey Box, covering different aspects of IT setup: External Network, Internal Network, Wireless Network, Web Application, etc.
Many organizations have a detailed plan to perform a combination of these tests every year.
I think this is the right time to pause and ask a few questions:
What value are you deriving from the annual penetration tests?
Could you put some of that budget to a different and better use (Compliance permitting)?
