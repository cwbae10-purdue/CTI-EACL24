I'm not actively picking on the Eastern Bloc, but finding purely malicious IP blocks there is duck soup.
In this posting I'll be looking at UralNet, which is registered to an organization in Russia, but appears to be administered out of the Ukraine.
Interestingly, I can't pull an MX or A record for uralnet.biz.
It doesn't appear they take abuse notifications too seriously.
Robtex.com offers an excellent routing graph (to show who provides their upstream services) that I should have been including in the previous entries.
Also it hosts the callback site:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.2)
Host: ramshabirthday.ru (91.211.65.33)
mmunication that happens first over .gif files and then over SSL.
Given its unique C&C structure, I'm surprised this botnet hasn't gotten more play by the malware authors.
The first stage looks like this:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 03 Mar 2009 02:16:55 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.41 (Unix) PHP/5.2.8 with Suhosin-Patch mod_perl/1.30 mod_ssl/2.8.31 OpenSSL/0.9.8e
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=SetupAntivirusXP.exe
Going back to 91.211.65.99 (onlinenotify.net) I wanted to highlight some fun language, italicized for effect:
I agree, those "third hands" can be a real bugger.
Also on this IP: 91.211.65.99-freewebscaners.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/3.01Gold (Macintosh; I; 68K)
Looking at that script you see the following obfuscation:
Deobfuscating (and reordering a bit) the above you can see an interesting tidbit - they are attempting to detect whether you are a crawler, and if so, the page won't redirect you to malware!
That's one way the malware folks are trying to stay off the StopBadware (et.
al) radar.
