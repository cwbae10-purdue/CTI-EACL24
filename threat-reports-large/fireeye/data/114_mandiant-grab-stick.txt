We're taking our State of the Hack webinar series on the road -- to the 22nd Annual FIRST conference in Miami, FL!
Kris Harms and I will present the next State of the Hack webinar in front of a live audience at the MANDIANT booth (#5), on Wednesday, June 16, from 12:30-1:30PM EDT.
And for this webinar only, we'll be taking live questions from the floor.
Of course, you can also ask questions on the webinar chat channel if you're not in Miami with us.
As usual, we'll also cover a few case studies.
We're going to focus on cases that started out as one thing, but turned out to be something completely different.
In the words of VP Steve, "It's like we went to see a fight, and a hockey game broke out."
There will be more time than usual for Q&A;, by webinar chat and live from the exhibitor hall.
If you plan to attend the conference, stop by our booth before and during the broadcast.
We'll try to take your questions live on the air - about the case studies, or about other interesting topics.
