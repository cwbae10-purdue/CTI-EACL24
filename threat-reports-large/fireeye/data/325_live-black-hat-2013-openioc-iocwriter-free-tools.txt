In the midst of Black Hat USA 2013, Kristen Cooper sits down with Will Gibb, a threat indicator engineer at Mandiant and the lead maintainer of several OpenIOC projects.
Gibb is the creator of a new open source tool, IOC_Writer.
The tool creates and manipulates OpenIOC objects and moves data in and out of the OpenIOC format.
In this podcast, Gibb discusses the tool's capabilities and how it can enable other security professionals and systems developers to easily add IOC 1.1 support into their applications.
If you are at Black Hat, don't miss out on Gibb's Arsenal presentation today at station 7 and other Mandiant activities at the show.
