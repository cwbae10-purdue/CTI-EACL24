Our worldwide sensor network provides researchers at FireEye Labs with unique opportunities to detect innovative tactics employed by malicious actors and protects our clients from these tactics.
We recently uncovered a coordinated campaign targeting Internet infrastructure providers, a media organization, a financial services company, and an Asian government organization.
The actor responsible for this campaign utilized legitimate digital certificates to sign their tools and employed innovative techniques to cloak their command and control traffic.

In March of 2014, we detected Kaba (aka PlugX or SOGU) callback traffic to legitimate domains and IP addresses.
Our initial conclusion was that this traffic was the result of malicious actors ‘sleeping’ their implants, by pointing their command and control domains at legitimate IP addresses.
As this is a popular technique, we did not think much of this traffic at the time.
Further analysis revealed that the HTTP headers of the traffic in question contained a Host: entry for legitimate domains.
As we have previously observed malware families that forge their HTTP headers to include legitimate domains in callback traffic, we concluded that the malware in this case was configured in the same way.
An example of the observed traffic is as follows:
POST /C542BB084F927229348B2A34 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C)
