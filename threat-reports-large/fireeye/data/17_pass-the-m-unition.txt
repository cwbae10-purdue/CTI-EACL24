Welcome to M-unition, MANDIANT's new, external blog for sharing interesting research, new tools and thought provoking ideas.
MANDIANT's employees come from a diverse background with a wide range of interests and specialities, and M-unition will reflect that.
M-unition will focus on techniques and tools to identify and analyze indicators of compromise on a host or throughout an entire enterprise.
While much of the content will leverage the tools and techniques we use, it is our desire to build upon others doing similar work in the community.
At M-unition, we will share information to combat a whole host of problems.
No pun intended.
