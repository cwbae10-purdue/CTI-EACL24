There doesn't seem to be a day that goes by that I don't have something new to add on McColo.
It's not that I am trying to target their fine colocation facility, and it's not that I have a thing against Scotland (har har), it's just that our appliance keeps detecting more and more badness coming out of their subnets.
Today I'd like to briefly mention a couple examples of what McColo is doing that no one else is talking about.
I'll be doing this in a couple parts just to break up the content.
First up to bat is XPAntiVirus, which has a ton of different names, but is basically the same software as yesterday.
It's your basic Rogue that sends you fake alerts to entice you to buy yet another Rogue.
Lots of people talk about the sample itself, or maybe even where it's hosted, but no one is talking about its callback features!
Here you can see XPAntiVirus calling home and receiving instructions - encrypted of course.
I rewrote most of the string as I'm sure it has information about my lab.
At first glance it looks similar to base64, and may very well be base64 encoding on top, but underneath there is some sort of encryption as well.
I plan to investigate the encryption more later.
As you see below, 208.72.169.114, a McColo IP, is being used for the callback.
GET /cset.php?id=g/kjlk12nioJIONa3n23rlk23r/1n512KJOSIDFn/klj239nIOQPne23na97235/kl1391EIO+knla290hjgaqiSDFIOn+lkjj1290ganslkHJLKHFGSDiopqpoQU931/nkls111asdfSDFKL13n/kl1jklj23rj2JFLSDKJOIUEW801241HNasdfas3huhAFsd= HTTP/1.1

After the above HTTP GET to cset.php is issued, a GET to uget.php happens.
You'll notice that there is no response, other than essentially an ACK from the server.
A simple hypothesis is that the Bot checks in with some unique identifiers, the C&C requests some more data, the Bot sends it, and the transaction finishes.
GET /uget.php?id=eniDWI1211ni12Fds90E+sdqiUHQ13h8asdD+sdf21iHOA/h1o887912FDSFEjfewo231jJIj3h+sdf90hUWqni31n+jiko1239FSD/jioE90321hsdf9weiho31/sdiiii217sdfIIOSUD+dfsio34EFDSjioSDjFIo HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Oct 2008 03:31:44 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.41 (Unix) PHP/5.2.6
You'll notice that the IP is hard coded in the HTTP header.
There's lots of noise about fast flux these days, but in all the McColo based Botnets, all the communication uses hard coded IPs.
What AntiVirus2009/XPAntiVirus is currently using fast flux for is for the download of the malicious binaries.
For instance, here is a download for "AntiVirus2009" from yesterday:
GET /download/av_2009.exe HTTP/1.1
Unless-Modified-Since: Mon, 27 Oct 2008 10:09:00 GMT
Yesterday, this host resolved to 208.72.169.100, a McColo IP.
Today, though, it's 89.149.251.56.
These guys seem to have some good information on this - http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2008/10/diverse-portfolio-of-fake-security_28.html
Interestingly, for the same piece of software, the initial call back that happened on install remains with the old IP (this still revoles to 208.72.169.100 at time of writing):
GET /firstrun.php?product=AV9&aff=[blocked]&update=2409av9nv&time=01:01:01%20AM HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
