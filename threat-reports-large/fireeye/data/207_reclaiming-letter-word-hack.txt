Say the word "hack" or "hacker", and the reaction is generally one of fear, disdain or both.
The term generally brings to mind some variation of a lone, shifty-eyed figure hunched over a keyboard, mumbling to himself while orchestrating a virtual smash-and-grab.

While black hat hackers seek to cause disruption or steal valuable data, white hat hackers are still working to make computers and networks work better and more securely.

Targeted attackers have a mission and that's to steal your company's valuable assets.
Once you put a face with a name you see why prevention will ultimately fail and detection is key.
