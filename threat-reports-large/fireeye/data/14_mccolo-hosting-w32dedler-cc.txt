Continuing the theme of last article, here is another example of McColo hosting a Command and Control server.
It appears they are nice enough to host the C&C for a 2004 worm known as Dedler.
Symantec has a page about it - http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-050714-2558-99 - but unfortunately they don't show any of the C&C behavior.
McAfee also has a page - http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_122235.htm - but again, no C&C listed.
ThreatExpert, as usual, comes through in the clutch!

Most of the domains listed by TE are down... but one at McColo is alive and well.
www.laderses.com, www1.laderses.com, www2.laderses.com, wwwbb.laderses.com, etc (wildcard dns entry) currently resolve to 208.72.169.242.
The other active domains, fabasten.com and manadust.com, point to 67.210.13.95, which is hosted by cernel.net.
(future blog posting alert!)
GET /img/gt.cgi?s=251902489017&r=jbab HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache/1.3.31 (Unix) PHP/4.3.8
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
Granted, Dedler is a pretty old worm, but a couple hundred K of communication shows it's not dead!
One more strike against our friends at McColo.
