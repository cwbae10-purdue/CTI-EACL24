We are pleased to announce the conclusion of the fifth annual Flare-On Challenge.
The numbers are in and we can safely say that this was by far the most difficult challenge we’ve ever hosted.
We plan to reduce the difficulty next year, so it may be that the 114 people who solved this year’s challenge solved not only the most difficult Flare-On to date, but the most difficult Flare-On there ever will be.
The prize for these amazing and dedicated Reverse Engineers is a magic decoder buckle and coin insert.
It can be used to decode and encode secret messages using a pre-shared key.
It is based on a crypto system known as a Diana Cipher.
They will be shipping soon.
