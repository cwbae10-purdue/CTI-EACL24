Willi Ballenthin and I will be presenting the Fresh Prints of Mal-ware: Vulnerability and Exploit Terminology Decoded webinar tomorrow at 2PM ET.
Join us to learn the different types of flaws being found in modern software systems (and a bit about what to do about them).
We will discuss old standbys like buffer overflows and memory corruption, along with web application flaws like cross-site scripting and SQL injection.
We'll also relate each vulnerability type to recent headlines.
There will be plenty of time at the end of the webinar for your questions.
However, if you can't make it, Mandiant's Lucas Zaichkowsky will be tweeting highlights using the hashtag #M_FP.
