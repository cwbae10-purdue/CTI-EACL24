Somehow, November is upon us.
We finally find ourselves facing the national and local elections that we've been anticipating for months - along with something we barely saw coming - the long road to recovery from Hurricane Sandy.
For those still dealing with her aftermath, all of us at Mandiant send our best.
Earlier this year, during the Black Hat USA conference, Mandiant's Kristen Cooper interviewed bloggers Carrie Jung and Mary Singh about women in the incident response profession.
The podcast was very well-received and showed us a need for focus on careers in cybersecurity.
That is why this month's M-Unition blog theme will be Career Paths in Cybersecurity - exploring some of the different paths that cybersecurity careers can take and sharing our thoughts on how best to prepare for a career in this industry.
During the month of November we'll be hearing from some of the best in the business - including a podcast from David J. Bianco, incident handler for General Electric, on careers in the information security field.
David's podcast is a follow-up to his post about the keys to landing a job in digital forensics and incident response.
I'm also excited to interview two members of the M-Unition editorial team, Jed Mitten and Willi Ballenthin, as part of the series.
Both bloggers have done amazing things in this industry and I am excited to share their story with our readers.
