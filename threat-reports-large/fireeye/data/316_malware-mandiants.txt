Beginning Friday July 12th, Mandiant began receiving reports of malicious software or "scareware" incorporating the Mandiant brand.
According to the reports we have received, users of infected devices experience a locked screen with a Mandiant logo and references to Interpol, the FBI and the "U.S.A. Cyber Crime Center."
Infected users are presented with a message accusing them of breaking several laws, and indicating that their computer has been locked pending payment of a "fine."
This malware is part of an illegal scam.
Mandiant has no involvement with this malware or the scam to extort money from those infected with it.
We recommend victims of this virus report the incident to the Internet Crime Center (http://www.ic3.gov).
