I'm currently writing this blog post from my hotel room at Blackhat Federal.
Jamie and I wrapped up our "Advanced Memory Forensics in Incident Response" class on Tuesday.
It went very well and we are both looking forward to teaching it again in Las Vegas.
I just finished giving my talk "Snort my Memory."
I detailed the talk in a previous blog post.
This post now includes links to available software.
MindSniffer is available here.
If you have any questions comments suggestions please feel free to contact me [email protected]
Following the release of MindSniffer I am thrilled to announce a NEW version of Audit Viewer.
This version includes the following features:
Process are marked in red if they have injected dlls
View imports/exports of PE files in memory.
This can be done by right clicking on memory sections
Signature Manager built into Audit Viewer to support py files generated by MindSniffer
Added sections and semaphore handle types
Memoryze Launcher - this a GUI wrapping Memoryze and allowing you to configure Memoryze all from a user interface.
No more batch scripts or xml files.
To utilize Memoryze Launcher, click "Launch Memoryze."
You can configure multiple jobs to run at once once they will all run, then the results are auto loaded into Audit Viewer for easier integration.
This is a huge feature and I'm very excited to get feed back on it.
Numerous bug fixes
