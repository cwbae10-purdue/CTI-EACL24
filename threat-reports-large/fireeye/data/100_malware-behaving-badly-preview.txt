Hope everyone on the northern east coast is staying warm during snowpaclypse.
Since I can't go anywhere I figured now is the right time to write about an upcoming webinar I am giving with Michael Graven.
The webinar entitled Malware Behaving Badly is on Thursday, February 18, at 2:00 p.m. EST.
The webinar title is a cute play on my DOD Cyber Crime (DC3) talk where I first introduced Malware Rating Index (MRI) into Audit Viewer (which is available for download).
If you saw my DC3 talk or viewed the slides and are wondering, "hey is this the same talk?"
the answer is...well a little bit.
The webinar will build off of a lot of the behaviors and theories I discussed at DC3.
We will be addressing new behaviors as well as looking at APT vs Mass Malware behaviors.
I've added two new configurable behaviors to MRI and did enough research to scrap a third.
I'll share those as well as give more real world examples of how malware exposes itself in memory.
For example the below listing shows the keylogger, the process and the file handle that process has.
The file handle is actual the log file the key logger is writing too.
