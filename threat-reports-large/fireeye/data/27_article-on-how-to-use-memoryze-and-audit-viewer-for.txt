I know not everyone reads OpenRCE, but it has been a favorite haunt of mine since Pedram launched it.
Over the holiday, I posted an article there about how to use Memoryze and Audit Viewer to do malware analysis since that has always been one of my hobbies.
NOTE: John O. pointed out that having spaces in your path where Memoryze was installed may prevent Audit Viewer from launching Memoryze because of how batch scripts' input is interpreted.
If you install Memoryze in a path with no spaces you should be fine.
Thanks to Pedram for helping with the post to OpenRCE and to Danny Quist at Offensive Computing for his blog entry.
