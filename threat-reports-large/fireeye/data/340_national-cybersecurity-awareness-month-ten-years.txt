This month marks the 10th anniversary of the National Cybersecurity Alliance and Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
It is an opportunity to engage public and private sector stakeholders - especially the general public - to create a safe, secure and robust cyber environment.
So 10 years on -- we must ask - what has changed in cybersecurity?
We went out and asked experts in the industry to chime in.
Here is what they had to say:
"We live in an increasingly dangerous world," says Chris Larsen at Blue Coat Systems.
Chris recently joined a team of experts for a podcast panel on the changing threat landscape.
From the first widespread worms and objectionable traffic to new malware threats and advanced targeted attackers, they cover the gamut of the past 10 years in this discussion.

Albin Ahmetspahic, M.S.
Network Security at DePaul University and member of the LinkedIn Information Security Group says, "Awareness has been raised and discussions are ongoing.
This is progress compared to the past.
Government leaders are listening and cybersecurity is incorporated into budgets."
At a recent Washington Post Cybersecurity Summit, Howard Schmidt, former White House cybersecurity coordinator, now a partner with Ridge Schmidt Cyber, discussed changes in the industry.
"The numbers [of threats] are getting bigger, but the internet is getting bigger.
It's not going up, it's staying level."
