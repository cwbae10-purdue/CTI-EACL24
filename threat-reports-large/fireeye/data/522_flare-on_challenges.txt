The first few challenges narrowed the playing field drastically, with most serious contestants holding firm through challenges 4-9.
The last two increased the difficulty level and proved a difficult final series of challenges for a well-earned finish line.
The FLARE On Challenge always reaches a very wide international audience.
Outside of the USA, this year’s country with the most finishers was China, with and impressive 11 winners.

The performance of contestants from Vietnam and Slovakia were also particularly commendable, as both held early leads in total finishers.
Based on the locations we are sending the challenge prizes to (people who responded with their shipping info by noon today) we can say that 33 countries had finishers this year.
This next graphs shows the total winners by country this year.
