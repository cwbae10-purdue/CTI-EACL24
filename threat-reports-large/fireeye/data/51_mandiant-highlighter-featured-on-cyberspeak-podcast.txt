Jason Luttgens and I were interviewed by Bret Padres and Ovie Carroll over at the CyberSpeak podcast regarding our log analysis tool, Highlighter.
Take some time to listen - the interview begins at 18m 10s, though I recommend listening to the whole show because those guys are fun and their content relevant.
