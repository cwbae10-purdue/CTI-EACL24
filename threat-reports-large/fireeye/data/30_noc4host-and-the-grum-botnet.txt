Update: As of 12/08, Jay from HiVelocity took the necessary steps to get these Command and Control servers shutdown.
The FE research team thanks him and his team profusely for their efforts.
Individual verification of customers is nearly impossible for a facility of their size, so we appreciate any efforts they can make after the fact.
We'd also like to thank Ross Thomas from SophosLabs and Phil Hay from Marshal TRACE for their research efforts.
Yesterday, my colleague Atif was looking at Pushdo/Cutwail, and he found a disturbing number of the C&Cs were hosted at NOC4HOSTS.
This isn't another McColo, but upon further investigation, there does appear to be a higher than average number of botnet controllers and malware hosted there.
The is part 1 of an N part series on C&Cs, malware, and exploits hosted at NOC4HOSTS.
First up to bat for Grum is 66.232.109.120.

The name appears to be faked on the registration based on a quick Google search.
Our friends at the Marshal TRACE lab supplied with us with some samples to confirm that the below is indeed Grum, whom they say is responsible for ~13% of the world's SPAM.
They report Pushdo/Cutwail at ~15%, which is also mainly hosted at NOC4HOSTS.
NOC4HOSTS is hosting another Grum C&C on 66.232.105.54.
This is registered to a gentleman in the Ukraine... but he couldn't possibly have used his real name in the registration...right?

They are hosting another Grum C&C on 206.51.237.93, again, thanks to Andrey:
I don't believe more packet data is needed, but they are also hosting Grum C&Cs on 66.232.114.152 and 74.50.100.117, both registered to Andrey.
One last note before the weekend, is that if you browse to these IPs directly (which I do not advise), you are presented with a fake TOS violation page, which is the template for the popular hosting platform cPanel.
The connections are actually succeeding, and the bots can communicate, so the bot herder must have thrown that page up to allay suspicion.
All the bots in our labs connecting to these servers are actively trying to send SPAM.
The findings above confirm our belief that a very large percentage of the world's SPAM is sent by botnets controlled through just a handful of data centers.
