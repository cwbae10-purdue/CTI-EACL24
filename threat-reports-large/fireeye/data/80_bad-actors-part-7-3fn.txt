“Wait … *beep beep* back up for a
second, Alex.
I heard 3fn was brought down
by the FTC!”
That would be correct!
On June 4th the FTC served a
takedown notice that essentially dropped 3fn (aka “Triple Fiber Network”, Pricewert,
APX Telecom, APS Communications) off the Internet.
I was approached by law enforcement looking
for evidence of malicious activities, and luckily, I was in the midst of
writing up an article for my Bad Actors blog series.
I decided to wait until a little time had
passed before publishing details as not to tip off 3fn and possibly ruin an
investigation.
(Note that the investigatory
group that approached me was at the federal level, but was not the FTC)
Below you’ll find my analysis of their
IP blocks and a large amount of data about the Bad Actors whom they supported.
Most of the links below are completely Not
Safe For Work, possibly malicious, and frankly, many of them are disgusting in name as well as content.
It’s not advised that you actually visit any of them.
I also have more content that I didn't post, and if you're interested in it, feel free to drop me a line.
As I’ve been talking about in previous
posts, there are many different aspects of a network infrastructure that a
criminal needs to have in place to operate a successful organization.
Let’s think about some of the pieces that
need to be stable for a simple client-server SPAM botnet such as Cutwail, which
was mainly hosted at 3fn.
First of all, you need to infect a user
with the Cutwail malware.
This malware
could be delivered via a web exploit (such as one of the recent vulnerabilities
in Adobe PDF, Office, FireFox, or DirectShow), via a social engineering attack
(“You’re missing this video codec – press OK to install), or possibly through other
vectors like E-mail or IM.
I’ve only
seen Pushdo/Cutwail distributed through Exploits and Social Engineering, so let’s
focus on those.
You need to
control the sites that are hosting exploits or malware, and you need to be able
to redirect users, or otherwise get users to visit said site.
3fn was doing plenty of both the redirection, and the actual hosting, as I’ll detail
To weaponize a web page, one needs to
be able to load custom malicious code onto it, such as javascript that attacks a
browser.
That means
either hacking a page to load your malicious code (like we saw with the big SQL
injection worms) or running all that infrastructure in-house on your own
dedicated sites.
In-house was the
Cutwail route, which shows the uptime and QoS that they required.
Running a website also requires controlling
DNS records, and to do the job right, you should control both the authoritative
nameservers for your domains, as well your local recursive resolvers
to be sure you aren’t being poisoned for your outbound communication (like
crawling for email addresses).
This is
the level of infrastructure the bad guys were using at 3fn.
Thus far, we need a web server to host
the exploit and a DNS server to point users in the right direction, and these things can lead to a successful delivery of an infection.
What else?
Well, for one, you’re
going to need a Command and Control server.
This is the server to which the malware (the infection "payload") will “phone home” to get
updates, instructions, etc.
We no longer
see these behemoth pieces of monolithic malware; everything is modular and able to be updated by a remote C&C server.
These
C&C servers will be reached either via a direct IP hard coded into the malware,
which is inflexible, or a domain name, which is flexible but can be hijacked by
Internet Good Guys like a registrar, registry, me ;-), etc.. Running a C&C requires another server, if to be done properly.
In the case of Cutwail, you’ll also need a
server to provide SPAM “templates”.
I
showed a simple template in an earlier post, although it was not a Cutwail template.
3fn was hosting a whole array of Cutwail SPAM
template servers, which I’ll detail further.
Another interesting problem facing
spammers is that, contrary to popular belief, the Internet Good Guys are very
quick to blacklist SPAM related IP addresses.
These IP addresses used to be mainly large servers pumping out massive
amounts of SPAM, but as most SPAM these days is sent by Bots (home users,
corporate users using their company’s infrastructure, etc) these
blacklists have been very difficult to maintain, although are certainly effective to
a degree.
A tactic that's come into favor
is tracking the IP addresses that host URLs (exploit sites, pharma sites, etc) that
are advertised inside SPAM, and then classifying other SPAM based on where the
embedded links are hosted.
Lists such as
the Spamhaus SBL/XBL work well to detect these types of malicious web servers,
and in turn the SPAM that takes advantage of these servers.
So to be sure you aren’t experiencing
diminishing returns on your SPAM campaigns, you better control a large number
of IPs as they are only going to be usable for a short period.
So far, for a SPAM infrastructure you
need an infection web server, a DNS server (or two as most registrations do/should
require a primary and secondary), a C&C server, at least one template server, and a ton of IPs.
With that in place, you
would be ready to start sending SPAM.
Let’s think about common SPAM – Rolex watches, Pharmaceutical, porn,
etc.
What is the content of that
SPAM?
Just text?
Probably not – there will be a link in there
for the user to click.
That link needs
to be hosted somewhere, and you have similar infrastructure needs as noted
above.
My purpose for detailing
infrastructure needs is that one may read the laundry list of domains hosted
below and think “well, those are shady-looking domains, but why is that illegal?”.
It’s illegal because these domains were being
used in SPAM (Blog, E-Mail, or otherwise) to spread exploits, perform ad/click/referer fraud, peddle illegal goods,
etc.
Sending unsolicited mail using botnets, regardless of what they're selling, is not an accepted business practice.
Back to 3fn - much like McColo and
Intercage, they were based out of Northern California.
However, unlike the name suggests, uplinks to Abovenet and Level3 does not a "Triple Fiber Network" make.
When asked by a top law enforcement official back in March if “there was
another McColo in the US” I said that there was 3fn, but that they were no
McColo.
I stand by that statement –
these guys were bad news, but they were no McColo.
Below we see the servers responsible
for Pushdo and Cutwail, the C&C and SPAM engine, respectively, since
October of ’08.
Recently Cutwail has been distributed independent of Pushdo, but this gives a higher level overview of the whole operation.
Note that many of the
IPs listed (such as the McColo ones) are no longer active and shown for posterity.
The bolded addresses are at 3fn – as you can
see it was a massive part of the SPAM infrastructure

Without further ado, here is a selection of the the
content that was hosted at 3fn.
If you are curious whether a domain has been used for SPAM or other malicious intentions, simply do a Yahoo!
search for the domain and make your own judgment.
The following domains sell illegal/fake medicine, sell illegal mp3s, sell fake AV software, host "warez", send SPAM and host its infrastructure, serve Kiddie Porn, and just about every other malicious thing you could imagine.
64.124.84.188 - bootleg mp3s Host: allsweetmp3.com 64.124.84.228 – Illegal pharma Host: pharmadrugs.us (dns 216.195.51.25, another 3fn IP) 64.124.84.229 – rogue AV blinds-shades.genericshop.biz redirects to http://antivirusonlineproscanner.com/promo/1/freescan.php?nu=880172&back=%3DDQx4jD2OMMMMI%3DO 64.124.84.235 - pharma dns hosting for: trustedsitelist.com hosted on 216.195.51.44 (3fn)
64.124.210.9 - search/click fraud.
You can clearly see below that there is search hijacking going on, where you attempt to search on one engine, and you are redirected to one participating in an "affiliate" program such that the malware author gets a few cents per redirection.
In this case, the original search queries after faked by the malware as well.

There is nothing more exciting than watching pounds disappear, especially when you've tried all sorts of different methods and products before.
