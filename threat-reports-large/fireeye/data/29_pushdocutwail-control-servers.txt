[Dec, 8th, UPDATE] Today NOC4HOSTS responded our abuse notifications and pulled the plug for all Pushdo CnC servers as mentioned in this post along with many Grum CnC as mentioned here.
We really say thanks to NOC4HOSTS for their positive response.
[Dec, 4th, UPDATE] One more Cnc within NOC4HOSTS 74.50.113.92.
[Dec, 4th, UPDATE] One more IP from NOC4HOSTS 74.50.120.87 is found to be serving Cutwail.
As in other cases this host is continuously delivering new SPAM templates hence becoming a cause of recent increase in Wordwide SPAM.
[UPDATE] We have Identified one more Cutwail CnC (74.50.125.72) hosted at NOC4HOSTS.
So far NOC4HOSTS has not responded to any of the abuse notifications sent by FireEye.
In my previous post, I discussed different aspects of Pushdoâ€™s command and control
architecture and its fallback mechanism.
Now I will discuss some datacenters which are currently hosting Pushdo and Cutwail command/control servers.
Let's first discuss the Cutwail CnCs, as these are the ones which supply daily SPAM ammunition to bots all over the world in the form of new templates.
In the absence of these servers, the Pushdo botnet will no longer be able to send SPAM.
One such server is currently located in Estonia hosted by STARLINE WEB SERVICES having an IP address 92.62.100.95:1995.
This is the same data center used by Srizbi few days back in an attempt
to regain its control.
This attempt did not prove to be very fruitful after
a quick response by the community and Estonian CERT.
UPDATE: Estonia has pulled this server offline and we sincerely appreciate their swift action.
Here is the WHOIS response against 92.62.100.95
inetnum: 92.62.100.0 - 92.62.100.255
descr: Starline Web Services
status: ASSIGNED PA
source: RIPE # Filtered
person: Viktor Norin
address: Pae 21
abuse-mailbox: [email protected]
SPAM templates provided by this server have mostly been fake job offers to tempt users into sending their resumes to the given email addresses.
I guess it's another social engineering trick to snatch people's personal information.
