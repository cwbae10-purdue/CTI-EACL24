Security conferences come and go and most are well attended by information security practitioners for professional development and networking.
But what about the executives who are responsible for strategy and who hold the budgets - what conferences should they attend?
With MIRcon 2013, Nov. 5-6, Washington D.C., around the corner, we want to emphasize the importance of C-level buy in.
From seeking financial benefits, integrating information security with other departments and ensuring overall brand trust, security has quickly become a C-suite issue.
At MIRcon 2013, we have a track tailored to those who see security as a big picture issue.
By attending the management track, attendees can learn about the laws that govern programs, hear from a panel of media on how they cover the latest threats and get real world perspectives on facing targeted attackers.
Mandiant's Chief Security Officer, Richard Bejtlich discusses what the management track has to offer attendees in the video below.
