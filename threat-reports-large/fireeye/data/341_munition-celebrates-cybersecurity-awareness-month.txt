Welcome to October, everyone!
And let me be among the first to wish you a very happy and secure National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NSCAM) - the 10th anniversary of that designation.
While much of America spends this month planning costumes, sneaking candy corns and devouring all things pumpkin-spiced, the folks at DHS spend October sharing their collective wisdom on several key cybersecurity themes - everything from cybersecurity as a shared responsibility and mobile cybersecurity issues to training the next generation of our cyber workforce.
Here at M-Unition, we will be sharing complementary content of our own, which we hope you'll find interesting and instructive:
A Q&A; session with a professor who will be weighing in on cyber education and the next generation of cybersecurity leaders.
A post from Mandiant's CSO, Richard Bejtlich, discussing MIRcon's management track and why CISOs should plan to attend the annual conference.
A post from Mandiant's Chris Bream on MIRcon's technical track and what attendees will learn from leading industry cybersecurity experts.
A LinkedIn fill-in-the-blank series addressing the question, "As we celebrate a decade of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month - we have to ask - what has been the biggest change in security over the past 10 years?"
We hope you'll come back often this month - and that we'll get to see you at MIRcon, which is just weeks away.
If you haven't already registered, it's not too late!
We hope to see you there.
