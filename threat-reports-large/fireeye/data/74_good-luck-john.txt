Back in college, there was a local man who would stand in the main thoroughfare of the academic quad and wish everyone who walked by "Good Luck."
Depending on how well you knew him and how much luck you sought, he went by either "Good Luck John" - for those who knew him well; "John the Bagman" - for those just familiar with him; or "The Guy Who Says Good Luck All The Time" for those who were confused by him.
He was an endearing old man who became a fixture on campus.
It was a ritual for students to walk by him before every final exam to receive that one extra last bit of luck before determining whether you would matriculate or you would spend your summer taking classes in Lewisburg, PA. For whomever is appointed as America's new Cyber Security Czar, their first order of business should be to hire their own "Good Luck John" to be by their side at all times, because they're going to need it.
Among the top five things that the Cyber Security Czar may seek additional divine intervention on as they pursue the magnanimous task of protecting our nation's infrastructure:
Good Luck...finding a budget big enough to deal with this issue which is global, growing and out of control
Good Luck...balancing the Federal and commercial interests to create a united front in solving a united problem
Good Luck...understanding that the Advanced Persistent Threat is actually an Advanced Persistent Reality
Good Luck...reading through all of these published reports on cyber security, because the shortest report that I have seen in the past three months has been over 50 pages
Good Luck...finding evil and solving crime against perpetrators who are global, organized, abundant, and not under our legal jurisdiction
