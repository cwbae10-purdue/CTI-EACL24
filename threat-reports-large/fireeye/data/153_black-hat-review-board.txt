MANDIANT would like to congratulate Jamie Butler on his appointment to the Black Hat Review Board.
Black Hat is one of the premier technical security conferences, and Jamie's appointment to its board is a testament to his contributions in advancing the field of computer security.
Jamie has been a long-time trainer at this conference and will still be teaching Advanced Memory Forensics in Incident Response there with Peter Silberman.
MANDIANT will also be teaching Malware Analysis, Advanced Malware Analysis, and Incident Response: Black Hat Edition at the 2011 show.
We look forward to the cutting-edge presentations and discussions at Blackhat USA 2011 and hope to see you there!
