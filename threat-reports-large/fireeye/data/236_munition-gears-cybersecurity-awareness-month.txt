Welcome to October, everyone - and please let us be the first to wish you a very happy National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM)!
While NCSAM hasn't quite gone mainstream like, say, Thanksgiving or Presidents' Day, its focus is crucial for the tens of millions of us who rely on the Internet for everything from work to electricity to news, commerce and security.
October has been designated National Cybersecurity Awareness Month in an effort to engage and educate the public about our shared responsibility for online security.
All month, the folks at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are going to be sharing their collective wisdom around several key cybersecurity themes - and we at Mandiant will be providing complementary posts with own perspective on these crucial issues.
Here's what you can look forward to:
Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity.
DHS will provide content focusing on national and local efforts to prevent identity theft and other cyber crimes.
M-Unition will feature the third post in our Victim Notification series by Kevin Albano.
Industry Efforts in Cybersecurity.
DHS will highlight strategies and tools businesses of all sizes - including small business - can use to bolster their own cybersecurity defenses.
M-Unition will address "Why Security Awareness is Important," by Richard Bejtlich.
K-Life: Digital Literacy Efforts.
DHS will showcase the urgent need to develop cyber education programs to train the next generation cyber workforce.
M-Unition will offer a sneak peek of November's theme: Cybersecurity as a Profession.
And don't forget Mandiant's annual conference, MIRcon, Oct. 17-18, Washington, DC, is just a few weeks away.
I hope to see you there!
Stay tuned for these posts, and more, as we kick-off Cybersecurity Awareness month on M-Unition.
