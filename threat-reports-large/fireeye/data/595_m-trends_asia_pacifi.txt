Since 2010, Mandiant, a FireEye company, has presented trends, statistics and case studies of some of the largest and most sophisticated cyber attacks.
In February 2016, we released our annual global M-TrendsÂ® report based on data from the breaches we responded to in 2015.
Now, we are releasing M-Trends Asia Pacific, our first report to focus on this very diverse and dynamic region.
Some of the key findings include:
Most breaches in the Asia Pacific region never became public.
Most governments and industry-governing bodies are without effective breach disclosure laws, although this is slowly changing.
The median time of discovery of an attack was 520 days after the initial compromise.
This is 374 days longer than the global median of 146 days.
Mandiant was engaged by many organizations that have already conducted forensic investigations (internally or using third parties), but failed to eradicate the attackers from their environments.
These efforts sometimes made matters worse by destroying or damaging the forensic evidence needed to understand the full extent of a breach or to attribute activity to a specific threat actor.
Some attacker tools were used to almost exclusively target organizations within APAC.
In April 2015, we uncovered the malicious efforts of APT30, a suspected China-based threat group that has exploited the networks of governments and organizations across the region, targeting highly sensitive political, economic and military information.
