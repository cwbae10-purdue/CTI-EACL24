Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has recently compromised three widely-used online communications websites, each of which could have serious real-world consequences for Syria’s political opposition.
July 16: SEA hacked the Swedish site Truecaller, home to the world's largest online telephone directory, with over a billion phone numbers in over 100 countries.
SEA claimed this attack also gave it access codes to more than a million Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Gmail accounts.
The initial attack vector was an older, vulnerable version of WordPress.
July 21: SEA hacked the video and text messaging service Tango, stealing more than 1.5 TB of data, including user information, true names, phone numbers, emails, and personal contacts for millions of accounts.
Again, the attack vector was a vulnerable version of Wordpress CMS (v 3.2.1), which gave SEA unauthorized access to the database server.
July 24: SEA hacked Viber, a free online calling and messaging application used by more than 200 million users in 193 countries.
Viber acknowledged the attack, explaining that the initial compromise vector was an email phishing scam which enabled SEA to access two customer support sites.
Thus far, the company has denied that private user information was lost.
Impact: why are these SEA attacks important?
SEA, just like other “patriotic hackers” around the world, is proving that a small group of expert hackers can be a force on the international stage.
SEA pays no attention to traditional international borders, attacking both Syrians and non-Syrians, inside Syria and in many other countries.
Successful attacks on international communications sites such as TrueCaller, Tango, and Viber could give Syrian intelligence access to the communications of millions of people.
Such attacks can also put human beings in real danger through espionage, intimidation, and/or arrest.
