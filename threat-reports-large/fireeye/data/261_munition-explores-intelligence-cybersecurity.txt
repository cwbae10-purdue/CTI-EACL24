Happy New Year, everyone!
We hope your 2013 is off to a wonderful start.
Here at M-Unition, we're focusing this month on the Importance of Intelligence - essentially, what we (and you) need to know in order to provide the best possible incident response.
This month we'll be diving deep into the work that goes into understanding attackers and their networks - facilitating responses that stop them and mitigate damage.
You won't want to miss the blog posts we've got planned this month on the importance of intelligence:
"Chinese Leadership Change and the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)" by Christopher R. Lew, Ph.D.
An interview with Principal Threat Intelligence Analyst, Jen Weedon
"Intelligence and the C-Suite" by Vice President of Customer Success, Grady Summers
We've got a lot to share about the importance and process of intelligence gathering.
