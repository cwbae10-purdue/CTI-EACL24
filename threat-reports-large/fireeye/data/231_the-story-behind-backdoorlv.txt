From May of this year, we have seen a sudden uptick in the number of samples of an interesting malware we call Backdoor.LV.
We have seen this malware primarily using websites hosting .exes to propagate.
The HTTP header below shows one such example from which the malware was downloaded.
A quick look up on the location of the IP in the HTTP header "94.129.29.233" shows that the IP is located in Kuwait.
Location from where binary was downloaded:
GET /Server.exe HTTP/1.1
VT analysis of the binary that was analyzed:
WHOIS of the IP:
inetnum: 94.129.0.0 - 94.129.127.255
descr: 3G allocation, VAS allocation, 2G allocation
status: ASSIGNED PA
source: RIPE # Filtered
Also interesting were the names of some of the domains used.
Many of the domains used names referring to the Middle East.
To figure out where the destination C2s were being hosted, we took a subset of the domains that we noticed in the FireEye Malware Protection Cloud (MPC) and mapped them to the countries in which they were hosted.
This is what we came up with.
Particularly interesting was the C2 communication.
The malware was seen talking back to its CnC using a custom protocol over port 80.
The communication between the infected machine and its
command and control server looks like this:
As you can see in the figure above, the malware gathers the following information from the compromised machine and sends it to the CnC.
