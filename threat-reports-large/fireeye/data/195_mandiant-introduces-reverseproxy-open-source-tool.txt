Today, Mandiant™ is making available a highly efficient reverse HTTP(S) proxy called simply 'RProxy™'.
We are releasing RProxy as an open sources tool to encourage the general community to participate in its evolution.
You can download the tool here.
At Mandiant we avoid trying to re-invent the wheel when it comes to software;so why create another reverse-proxy?
Many of the wonderful open-source proxies that exist today are tailored to the average GET <-> RESPONSE traffic types.
For each request, they may spawn a new thread; create a new connection to the back-end, or both.
Many of the projects we analyzed could not handle large streams of data efficiently since they would block until the full client request has been received (hey, where did my memory go?).
Resource exhaustion was a common issue under high load, such as memory, file descriptors, CPU, etc.
These existing tools are designed perfectly for common traffic flows, but can quickly capsize under pressure.
Mandiant had a requirement for a proxy that could scale to thousands of simultaneous SSL connections, with certificate verification, and various caching methods, all while maintaining a low system resource footprint.
After testing the various popular and well maintained open-source proxy projects, we could not find one that met our specific needs.
That's why we decided to roll out our own.
