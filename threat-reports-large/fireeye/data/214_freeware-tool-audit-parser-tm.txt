Mandiant RedlineTM and IOC Finder TM collect and parse a huge body of evidence from a running system.
In fact, they're based on the same agent software as our flagship Mandiant Intelligent ResponseÂ® product.
During the course of their "audits", these tools conduct comprehensive analysis of the file system (including hashing, time stamps, parsing of PE file structures, and digital signature checks), registry hives, processes in memory, event logs, active network connections,DNS cache contents,web browser history, system restore points, scheduled tasks, prefetch entries, persistence mechanisms, and much more.
Once this data is collected, Redline and IOCFinder currently allow you to do one of two things:
Review the contents of memory through a visual workflow in Redline
Search for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and generate a report of "hits"
But what if you want to analyze all of the raw evidence - not just memory or IOC hits - and do traditional forensics and timeline analysis?
That's where Audit Parser steps in.
It's the newest addition to Mandiant's portfolio of free software.
Audit Parser is simple:it takes the complex XML data produced by Redline or IOCFinder and converts it into human-readable tab-delimited text.
You can then easily review the output in Excel, use a dedicated CSV file viewer (we're fans of "CSVed" and"CSVFileView"), import it into a database, or grep / manipulate it to your heart's content.
When paired with Redline's new start-up workflow to build a "collector" script, Audit Parser gives you a complete(and free)live response analysis toolkit.
You can customize the Redline collector to gather as much or as little evidence as desired, run it on your target system, and then easily review all of the results following a quick conversion with Audit Parser.
The screen capture below shows Audit Parser's options - it's pretty straightforward to use:
Tabular data in Excel doesn't make for the most exciting screen shots, but we wanted to give you a glimpse into what the output looks like and the extent of evidence available for filtering, sorting, and analysis:
A filtered view of a file system audit, showing complete file metadata for all PE files within %SYSTEMROOT% created between 2011-2012 that are not digitally signed.
A portion of a prefetch audit, showing how the contents of .PF files are automatically parsed to provide last time executed, # of times executed, and original file path metadata.
A portion of a full registry dump, showing review of Active Setup Installed Components registry keys - the data includes all key value / data pairs and last modified dates.
A portion of the parsed Windows event logs, showing review of process auditing events including event log source, time generated, event ID, and full event message contents.
The default "comprehensive collector" script in Redline collects all of the artifacts listed above, as well as many more.
But wait - that's not all!
Audit Parser also contains timeline generation functionality.
Just specify a time & date range, and it will build a sorted timeline of all file system, registry, and event log events that occurred within that period.
Future releases will add more audit types and customizability to this feature.
Audit Parser is written in Python and is distributed under the Apache License.
It requires the lxml (http://lxml.de/) library.
We're also distributing a Windows EXE built with Py2EXE for users that may not have a Python environment set up.

I'll also be at Black Hat USA next week teaching Mandiant's Incident Response course where we'll be going through an in-depth live response analysis lab using Redline, Audit Parser, and other forensic tools.
I was on a recent M-Unition podcast discussing the class and how it is completely revamped for 2012.
You can listen to the podcast here.
Hope to see you there!
