Today, we released a new report from FireEye Labs entitled Supply Chain Analysis: From Quartermaster to Sunshop.
The report details how many seemingly unrelated cyber attacks may, in fact, be part of a broader offensive fueled by a shared development and logistics infrastructure â€” a finding that suggests some targets are facing a more organized menace than they realize.
Our research points to centralized planning and development by one or more advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.
Malware clearly remains a desired cyber weapon of choice.
Streamlining development makes financial sense for attackers, so the findings may imply a bigger trend towards industrialization that achieves an economy of scale.
