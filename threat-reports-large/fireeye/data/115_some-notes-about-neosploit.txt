The Little Picture
I have a huge pile of notes on various types of malware and exploits.
Meticulous details from where I look with my [metaphorical] microscope, but not a lot of big-picture stuff, because that usually takes much more time than just reading through a hexdump.
So, I'm going to write a series of blog posts like these, looking at the little picture.
Some of my explanations might be a little bit terse.
I have a bad habit of going: "Here, look at this disassembly, isn't it obvious what it's doing".
But, teaching how to read this stuff is a lot of work.
So, I hope you don't find reading this to be too tedious if I'm short on explanations.
