UPDATE: Although the below is still interesting data, Telia has withdrawn the routes for McColo's net blocks
As we were monitoring Srizbi and Rustock in our labs today, all of a sudden a sample from the lab started connecting to a routable McColo C&C server.
This McColo hosted C&C server, with an IP of 208.66.194.22, was again fully responding to Rustock.
It appears they're back!
The best part about this story is that they haven't physically moved their servers... they're still in Market Post Tower in sunny San Jose.
Telia (whom I contacted) appears to have low enough standards that they are providing McColo a new cross-connect.
