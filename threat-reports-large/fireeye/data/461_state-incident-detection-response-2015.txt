2014 brought about a multitude of high-profile breaches, critical vulnerabilities, and newly-discovered threat groups.
Has this exposure and awareness changed the way companies are approaching security, incident detection, and containment and response?
How will targeted attacks continue to evolve?

It seemed like each week in 2014 brought about a new, highly-publicized breach.
Are organizations doing enough to detect or stop these attacks?
