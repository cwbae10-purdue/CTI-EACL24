Another Black Hat has come and gone, and with it the flurry of activities while in Las Vegas, NV.
We here at Mandiant were in full swing at the show with a booth, training courses, M-Lair, arsenal sessions, and book signings; just to name a few events.
It's a lot to take in, but I made sure to snap some photos through-out the week.
During the conference we held a couple of podcast sessions to discuss new and popular freeware tools:
Live from Black Hat 2013: Redline, Turbo Talk, and Arsenal
Live from Black Hat 2013: OpenIOC, IOC_Writer, and Other Free Tools
To add something new to the mix, we hosted two "Day in the Life" sessions to show attendees what a typical day is like for those in our Mandiant Labs (M-Labs) and Managed Defense MCIRT Analyst teams.
Each presentation was met with a packed room and great questions from the audience.

I hope you had a chance to meet-up with us at one of our many events while at Black Hat 2013.
We hope to see you at our annual conference, MIRcon, November 5-6, at the JW Marriott in Washington, DC.
