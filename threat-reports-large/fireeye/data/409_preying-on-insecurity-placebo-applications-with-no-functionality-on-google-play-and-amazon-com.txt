FireEye mobile security researchers recently uncovered, and notified Google and Amazon to take down, a series of anti-virus and security configuration apps that were nothing more than scams.
Written easily by a thieving developer with just a few hundred lines of code then covered with a facade of images and progress bars, the seemingly useful apps for Android’s operating environment charge for installation and upgrade but do nothing.
In other words, placebo applications.
Fortunately all the applications have been removed from the Google Play store due to our discovery.
Up to 50,000 downloads in some cases, these fake apps highlight how cybercriminals are exploiting the security concerns consumers have about the Android platform.
In this case, we found five (!)
fake antivirus apps that do nothing other than take a security-conscious user’s money, leaves them unprotected from mobile threats, and earns a criminal thousands of dollars for little work.
Uploaded by a developer named Mina Adib, the paid versions of the apps were available for Google Play customers outside the US and UK, while users in the UK and US could choose the free versions with in-app upgrade options.
Also available in third party markets such as appbrain.com[1] and amazon.com[2], the fraudulent apps ranged in price from free to $3.99.
The applications included:
Anti-Hacker PLUS (com.minaadib.antihackerplus) Price $3.99
JU AntiVirus Pro (com.minaadib.juantiviruspro) Price $2.99
Anti-Hacker (com.minaadib.antihacker) Free
Me Web Secure (com.minaadib.mewebsecurefree) Free
Me Web Secure Pro (com.minaadib.mewebsecure) Price $1.99
