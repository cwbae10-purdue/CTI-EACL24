Unsolicited emails are sent to users that tempt them to watch some interesting video.
When the user clicks on the given link, it leads them to a page, displaying a picture of a multimedia player besides the opening text above.
When the user clicks on the 'Play' button, the user is invited to download a binary file having name "StormCodec8.exe" or "StormCodec.exe".
