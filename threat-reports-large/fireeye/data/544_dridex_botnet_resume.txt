FireEye Labs observed that Dridex operators were active during the holiday season.
However, during the post-Christmas and New Year weeks, we observed a slowdown in their spam campaigns.
Interestingly, their breaks were short.
Over the past few weeks they have resumed operations and are building momentum.
A small Dridex spike was seen in the first week of January 2016, followed by a few large waves of Dridex campaigns in the following weeks, as seen in Figure 1.
FireEye Labs has studied this prolific spam botnet in the past, detailing some of its delivery mechanisms here and its takedown recovery here.

In addition, the campaigns mostly targeted the United States and United Kingdom, as seen in Figure 3.

The Dridex operators may have taken a break after Christmas, but soon after the New Year they ramped up their activities and resumed their operations as usual.
It is important for organizations to remain vigilant with user education, proactive detection technologies and security policies that help prevent cybersecurity threats.
