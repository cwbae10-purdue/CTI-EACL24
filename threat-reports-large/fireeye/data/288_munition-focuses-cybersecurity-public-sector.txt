Welcome to April, everyone!
This month, we at M-Unition are going to focus on ways that the public sector can apply private sector best practices and commercially available threat intelligence on advanced threat actors, to improve the efficiency of its cybersecurity programs.
President Obama's recent Executive Order on cybersecurity, which directs federal departments and agencies to use their existing authorities to provide better cybersecurity for the nation, has drawn attention to vulnerabilities in the public sector.
It seems like a perfect time to consult our experts - both in-house and outside Mandiant - to get their thoughts on what the private sector has to offer public sector cybersecurity efforts.
We've got some great content planned:
