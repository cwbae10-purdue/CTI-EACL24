At RSA 2009 today, Finjan announced that their research team has discovered a new botnet which they believe has already infiltrated about 1.9 million computers across the globe.
Although Finjan did not mention the name of the botnet in their blog post, VirusTotal scan results (for one of the secondary downloads) shown in their article identified it as the dropper for a known Trojan called Hexzone.
Hexzone coincidentally caught my attention while I was gathering material for my recent article about some emerging ransomware.
Hexzone has recently been seen downloading Trojan.Ransomlock, which blocks the user's access to all Windows resources and asks
the victim for money (ransom) in return for unlocking their system.
For details please refer to Ransomware on the loose..
In this post, I will try to shed light on some missing details about Hexzone.
Then I will show Hexzone's relationship with some other known malware, and in the end I will discuss my thoughts on the size of this un-named botnet.
Here is my initial analysis of the Hexzone sample mentioned in Finjan's report.
Normally Hexzone resides on the victim machine in the form of a 'Browser Helper Object'.
The reason it injects itself into the browser as a plug-in is to hijack the user's browsing sessions in order to blackmail them.
Here is how it happens, as the user tries to browse any web page from the infected PC, this plug-in leads the user to a fake page, displaying porn contents.
Along with porn contents a message is displayed in the Russian language.
"to delete (porn contents) select country and sends code 3981134 to room number (different for each country)."
As I explained in my last article, these SMS codes use paid "rooms".
These "rooms" have a concept like 1900 numbers
where it costs money to phone in.
Every time someone sends an SMS to
one of these rooms, a fixed amount of money is deducted from the
sender's balance and it gets transferred to the owner of the room.
Another shocking fact was that this page listed seven country names along with corresponding SMS room numbers.
Our initial observation that this SMS based ransom is only being used within Russia no longer holds true.
Now lets discuss the CnC part.
Upon execution It tries to contact a remote CnC server having IP address 91.205.111.52 which is owned by UKNETCOM LTD.
Here is the complete WHOIS record.

Interestingly, Trojan.RansomLock (as mentioned in my previous article) uses the same server for its CnC communication.
GET /getid.php?getcode=1&wid=60&client=unknown&u=4 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0b; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.0.2914)
GET /registerguid.php?guid={98607c80-9a71-494f-a81e-32b7bb536a0c}&wid=59&u=6&number=35743798&install=1 HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0b; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.0.2914) Host: ogggooogoggoog.com Connection: Keep-Alive where 9aga999a9gg99a.com and ogggooogoggoog.com are currently resolving to same CnC (91.205.111.52.)
in UK.
A reverse IP lookup on this IP shows 20 more domains hosted on the same CnC server.. 0jgj144c12g44j.com 23g3aff8aigff3.com 3igi333i3gg33i.com 3lglcnnbcmgnnl.com 4jgj444j4gg44j.com 9aga999a9gg99a.com 9pgphllghpgllp.com Csgsjzzjjcgzzs.com D6g6ddd6dggdd6.com Eigieeeieggeei.com F3g3fff3fggff3.com Fygyqrraq8grry.com Ggggsggzszgggg.com Iogoiiioiggiio.com K8g8kkk8kggkk8.com Lpgplllplggllp.com Nlglnnnlnggnnl.com Ogggooogoggoog.com Rygyrrryrggrry.com Uaga699h66g99a.com Xgggyoozywgoog.com Zsgszzzszggzzs.com
The domain whois shows all of these domains are owned by a person called Damir I Filatovskij.
It clearly shows that Hexzone CnCs are being shared by other malware as well.
This fact also became evident when I looked closely at the joebox.org analysis shown in Finjan's article.
There are some URLs mentioned in that picture which can clearly be identified as CnC communications for malware like Win32.AutoIt and WIn32.3proxy.
Evidence of this multilayered malware installation again gives weight to my observation that most modern malware do not live alone but instead form BotnetWebs.
It is possible that the zombie count discussed in the Finjan article includes zombies from multiple botnets instead of one.
The idea that a central management system is being used to control the complete botnetweb instead of an individual bontnet looks more believable.
A large figure like 1.9 million zombies is also understandable when we think in terms of a botnetweb.
Nothing can be said with complete confidence until Finjan's research team releases more information like MD5s of the parent dropper and/or the CnC coordinates.
