Welcome to June, everyone!
I hope your summer is off to a relaxing start.
Here at M-Unition, this month's focus will be on the utilities industry and its cybersecurity challenges.
We'll take a look at what makes the utilities industry an attractive target and why it is vulnerable to computer network attacks from a variety of threat actors; to include Advanced Persistent Threat actors.
We'll also explore organizational and structural issues across the industry.
We have lots of great content planned, including:
A look at the threat landscape, including findings from the recent House Energy & Commerce Committee report on cyber threats against the nation's power grid
An exploration of the difficulties defending complicated networks within utilities
A look at how an intense focus on compliance in the C-suite can hinder efforts to keep utility providers secure
