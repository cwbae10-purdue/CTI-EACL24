Welcome to July, everyone!
Here's hoping you had a safe and relaxing Fourth.
This month, Mandiant is prepping for Black Hat 2013, which kicks off July 27 in Las Vegas.
And we here on the M-Unition blogger team will be focusing on all things Black Hat - where, once again, Mandiant plans to have quite a presence.
During the next few weeks, we'll provide all the nitty-gritty details you need to follow all our activities at Black Hat, from information on where to find us on the exhibitor floor to can't-miss-content, including podcasts from Mandiant's CSO, Richard Bejtlich, to training sessions on Advanced Malware Analysis and Incident Response to receptions, presentations and more.
In the meantime, to make sure you're appropriately prepared for this year's event, we invite you to take a look at our wrap-up post of last year's Black Hat conference.
We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as we can in Vegas, and we welcome your thoughts on what you're most looking forward to at Black Hat.
