A new version of Highlighter has been released today!
A number of small bugfixes were made, as well as a significant performance improvement to drawing the graphic overview.
If you are using Highlighter, you will definitely want to get this updated version.
We also wanted to let folks know where we are looking to focus our attention next.
We have gotten a lot of requests related to large file support.
When I say large, I'm talking around 1GB and larger.
We've come up with a solution on paper, and we will begin implementation soon.
We can't promise any time frame, but come back and look for a new version periodically.
Also, please check out our forum for Highlighter at https://community.fireeye.com/welcome where you can tell us your use cases, ask others for help, or report bugs.
Thanks for using Highlighter- we hope you find it a useful tool and look forward to your feedback.
Here is a summary of changes from the 1.0.1 release notes:
- Fix: Tabs were mistakenly removed by input sanitization.
This has been corrected.
- Fix: The highlight hit count was incorrect - an additional hit per line was mistakenly being added.
This has been corrected.
- Fix: The events over time histogram was not properly displaying highlights.
This has been corrected.
- Fix: If text was selected in the textbox, and the user clicked on the highlight button, the selection would not be highlighted.
This has been corrected.
- Enhancement: The graphic overview now draws much faster.
