Hard as it is to believe, September is upon us - with all the backpacks, early bedtimes and pumpkin spice lattes that entails.
In keeping with back-to-school season, M-Unition is going to be focusing this month on learning - going back to the basics on cybersecurity and targeted threats.
We're styling it a bit like Cybersecurity 101 - an entry-level course wherein we enlist experts in the field to explore subjects in cybersecurity - what targeted threats look like, the damage that a determined attacker can do, the risks we face as attacks become increasingly sophisticated - and what can be done to minimize risk and mitigate damage.
We've got some great content planned, so be sure to come back for the following:
Defining The Win by Richard Bejtlich
Q&A; Series on NTFS INDX Buffers by Jeff Hamm & Willi Ballenthin
Threat Intelligence Series by Kevin Albano and Carlos Carrillo
