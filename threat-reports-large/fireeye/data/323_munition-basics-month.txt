Welcome to the dog days of summer, everyone.
Here's hoping you can enjoy a few days at the pool before it closes, host a final BBQ for friends, and enjoy the nice light commute to work before school is back in session.
This month on M-Unition we will be focusing on "back to basics."
From key tools security practitioners need in their arsenal to best-practices every cybersecurity professional needs to know, we've got you covered.
We hope you'll come back for the following:
A discussion with Mandiant's CSO, Richard Bejtlich, on his latest book, "The Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response"
Series of posts on OpenIOC, Indicators of Compromise and IOC_Writer by Will Gibb and Doug Wilson
A post on ways to detect file executions by Mary Singh
