It appears that not even David Spade can protect Capital One customers from phishing attacks.
A Srizbi sample in our lab today spat out some interesting spam.
As you can see below, the Botnet is using a standard obfuscation technique to get the end user to click on it.
The subdomain portion of the domain name is created in such a way that it looks legitimate at first glance.
This phishing site is a little different than the normal site that tries to get the user's credentials.
As we see on the site below, it tries to convince the user to download the binary directly due to a "stack overflow in a bank account".
Apparently, these spammers have a sense of humor!
