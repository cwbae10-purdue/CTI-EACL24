There's a segment of our Beta customers who have a data sharing
agreement with us, wherein they allow the appliance to send up the
malicious URLs and Botnet activity that it has discovered.
I wanted to
take a quick poke at some of these URLs to see what they were
exploiting, where they were hosted, whether they were "dual use" or
A quick background: Last week, our engineering team released a new version of our software to our beta sites.
It detects malicious webpages by replaying a copy of them (that was cached off the wire) against various web browser environments locally on the appliance.
For example, IE7 running Flash 9 and PDF Reader 8, or FF3.0.3 running Real Player 5 and Yahoo Toolbar 6, etc.
(I just made up these plugin versions... they probably aren't accurate).
What it means from a product standpoint is that we can detect web exploits (that are obfuscated or otherwise) without signatures.
There's a bunch of other stuff our appliance does once it detects an exploit, but this isn't a marketing article.
As I was following one URL down the rabbit holes that are <IFRAME>s, I came across this gem:
The above is obviously trying to emulate the Firefox/Google Safe Browsing feature.
When you click it, it brings you to a variety of pages, all of which try to sell you the Fake AV software "AntiVirus 2009".
Out of curiosity, I went and poked at the server hosting it to see what I could glean.
Imagine my surprise (sarcasm alert!)
when I found it was hosted by my good friends as McColo!
If you look back in our articles, you'll see a fairly deep connection between Malware, Botnets, and McColo.
With the shutdown of Atrivo, McColo seems to be the frontrunner for Botnet/Malware hosting - and who wouldn't appreciate an uptick in business, given this recent "economic downturn"?
10/27 A quick update - The sample in my lab downloaded a new DLL for itself called winsystems.dll last night.
hxxp://securedownloadcenter.com/zsa09/winsystems.dll.
I ran it through VirusTotal and 1 out of 32 detected the DLL as malicious.

10/27 edit 2 - (What is this, a Bill Simmons running diary?!)
- It just fetched a new binary - hxxp://securedownloadcenter.com/zsa09/zs880000.exe - Looks like 1 our of 34 this time.

A quick aside - Do you think it's time that someone told VirusTotal (who provides an /awesome/ service) that in English analisis is spelled with a "y"?
I know they're not an American company, but it seems like a quick symlink is in order.
