FireEye recently detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents that leverage a previously undisclosed vulnerability.
This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to execute a Visual Basic script when the user opens a document containing an embedded exploit.
FireEye has observed several Office documents exploiting the vulnerability that download and execute malware payloads from different well-known malware families.
FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and has been coordinating for several weeks public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.
After recent public disclosure by another company, this blog serves to acknowledge FireEyeâ€™s awareness and coverage of these attacks.
FireEye email and network solutions detect the malicious documents as: Malware.Binary.Rtf.
The attack involves a threat actor emailing a Microsoft Word document to a targeted user with an embedded OLE2link object.
When the user opens the document, winword.exe issues a HTTP request to a remote server to retrieve a malicious .hta file, which appears as a fake RTF file.
The Microsoft HTA application loads and executes the malicious script.
In both observed documents the malicious script terminated the winword.exe process, downloaded additional payload(s), and loaded a decoy document for the user to see.
The original winword.exe process is terminated in order to hide a user prompt generated by the OLE2link.
The vulnerability is bypassing most mitigations; however, as noted above, FireEye email and network products detect the malicious documents.
Microsoft Office users are recommended to apply the patch as soon as it is available.
