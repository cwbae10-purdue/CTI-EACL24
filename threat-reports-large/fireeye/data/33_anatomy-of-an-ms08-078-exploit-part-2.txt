This is part 2 of the article on MS08-078.
Below I'll talk about what this particular invocation of the exploit carried in terms of payloads.
So after the exploit succeeds, the first thing is does is download and execute a binary.
To do that, it needs to do a DNS lookup for the hostname of the server serving the malicious exe (often not on the same server as the exploit page).
I run a version of our FireEye appliance in my malware analysis rig, so that I can use our OS monitor to track system and network changes.
The real implementation tracks a whole lot more, but I stripped out the uninteresting data points.
