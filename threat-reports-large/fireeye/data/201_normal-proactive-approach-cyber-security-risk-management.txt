No matter what industry your company is in, you hear about organizations being compromised by targeted attacks nearly every day.
It's no secret that we depend on technology to house our most valued intellectual property.
It's also no secret that every organization can be a target for advanced attackers.
This is the "new normal".
Security breaches are inevitable; however, how you identify and respond to them is within your control.
During the month of June, our editorial team will be tackling risk management in cyber security.
According to the Ponemon Institute's 2011 Cost of Data Breach Study, the average cost of a data breach is $5.5 million.
With targeted attacks on the rise, it is important for organizations to fully understand the ramifications of an unwelcome attacker moving through their environment, collecting valuable information, and in most cases, using it against them.
We want to ensure you have the information you need to fully understand the types of threats your company may be faced with, what steps you can take to protect your assets, and why detection (not prevention) is the answer.
Some upcoming posts to keep an eye out for this month include:
"Compliance State of Mind" by Richard Bejtlich
"Personal Risk Management" by Kristen Cooper
"There is no bar of security; threats are not linearly progressive" by Lucas Zaichkowsky
In addition, Mandiant will be an exhibitor at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit in National Harbor, MD, June 11-14.
Watch for some posts created from agenda items we think you may benefit from.
