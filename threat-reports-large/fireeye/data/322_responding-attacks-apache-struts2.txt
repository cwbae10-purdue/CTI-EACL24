In mid-July of 2013, CVE - a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures - identified three potential exploits against the Apache Struts2 web framework.
HTTP requests are evaluated by the Apache Struts2 framework.
A bug in the Apache Struts2 code allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a web server.
In the wake of this public disclosure, Mandiant has been actively investigating a series of these of attacks.
This post is intended to highlight steps an organization can take to determine if they have been attacked from this vector.
Additional information regarding the Apache Struts2 vulnerability is available at the URL https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-015.

Attack Life Cycle
Mandiant's analysis of these compromised systems showed three common threads:
Attackers used search engine queries to identify websites that were running the Apache Struts2 web framework
Attackers copied exploit code from public blogs and scanned vulnerable systems
The initial exploit led to larger compromise
The earliest identified evidence of reconnaissance Mandiant discovered were search engine (Google or Baidu[1] were the most common) queries that led attackers to a vulnerable entity.
In the Apache logs, the referrer field recorded the initial search engine query that led the attacker to the vulnerable entity's web site.
We have chosen not to provide a screen capture or specifics regarding this activity because it would demonstrate how many servers may be vulnerable to this type of attack.
[1] Baidu is a Chinese-language search engine.
