In my previous article, I talked about the Ozdok command and control architecture and its fallback mechanisms in great detail.
That article was an attempt to highlight different approaches to take down this botnet theoretically.
But when it comes to the actual shutdown, it's far more complex than just finding out the command and control server coordinates and fallback mechanisms.
An actual shut down attempt requires someone to take the initiative and start a combined effort involving third parties like ISPs, registries, registrars, etc.
Instead of playing a passive role, this time FireEye
decided to come forward and start working with these groups to
make this happen.
The good news is that at the time of writing this
article, all the major Ozdok command and control servers (as mentioned
in my last post) have been taken down.
As it turns out, no matter how
many fallback mechanisms are in place, if they aren't all implemented
properly, the botnet is vulnerable.
