With targeted attacks continuing for the foreseeable future, you should be sure to take advantage of this opportunity to learn from leading industry cybersecurity experts.
The two day conference will help you learn how incident responders can accelerate response times while capturing relevant data from attacks in progress.
From our networking events to sessions that walk the technical crowd through latest threats, new tools, and trends, there are many valuable sessions for everyone in the information security community.
We'll discuss threat intelligence and what it really means, cover new network defense techniques from an attack perspective, demonstrate methods utilized by Mandiant's Managed Defense analysts to stay ahead of intruders through rapid live response, and take a deeper look at IPython's framework.
Our own Chris Bream talks through all of the different sessions from the Technical Track in the video below.
