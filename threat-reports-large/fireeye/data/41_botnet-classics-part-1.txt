An interesting aspect of botnet study is to attempt to learn the motives behind building a particular botnet or trying to find the intent of the criminal mind controlling all the zombies.
When it comes to botnet payloads, many different motives come to mind like DDOS, vulnerability exploitations, key logging, SPAM etc.
But not all botnets are capable of doing everything especially when it comes to vulnerability exploitations, DDOS and password stealing.
Amazingly most of the biggest botnets in recent times have been dedicated to sending SPAM.
Take for example Srizbi, Rustock, Storm(mostly), Grum and now Waledac.
IRC bots were the first breed of malware to build multi-purpose botnets.
These IRC Bots started to emerge as the next generation of malware after nifty worm breakouts like Blaster, Sasser and Slammer.
Here at Fire Eye Labs we monitor the communication of different types of bots with their command and control servers in a controlled environment.
The fun part of monitoring IRC CnC is that most of the time this communication is real-time, plain text and self descriptive.
Most commonly IRC Bot masters communicate their commands using IRC channel topics and/or through Private Messages.
Today I will discuss some of these bot commands extracted from my lab logs.
Lets see what these puppet masters are trying to do today:
