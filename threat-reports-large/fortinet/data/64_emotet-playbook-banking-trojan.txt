Adversary Playbook: The FortiGuard SE Team is releasing this new playbook on the threat actor group known as “Emotet” as part of our role in the Cyber Threat Alliance.
For more information regarding this series of adversary playbooks being created by CTA members, please visit the Cyber Threat Alliance Playbook Whitepaper.
Also view the FortiGuard Playbook Viewer detailing this campaign mapped to MITRE’s Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) model.
Emotet was first discovered in 2014 as a “simple” banking Trojan aimed at stealing financial data.
Simple is in quotes because, over time, it has not only evolved into a botnet but also added modularity, such as the ability to deliver malware using worm-like capabilities.
This is why the US Department of Homeland Security has identified it as “among the most costly and destructive malware affecting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, and the private and public sectors.”
Emotet is still highly active, and its daily activity is noted not only by the organizations affected by this pervasive threat, but by researchers and first responders worldwide trying to understand the latest additions and attack methodologies the Emotet authors have added to their war chest.
This latest playbook focuses on a specific Emotet attack campaign that FortiGuard Labs has observed as recently as a few weeks ago.
While this playbook is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of Emotet, as that would be impossible due to time constraints, but it does serve as a small glimpse into an otherwise impressive campaign of criminal behavior.
Emotet was first documented by FortiGuard Labs’ own Joie Salvio, who was at Trend Micro at the time.
The infection vector was simple – it was delivered via social engineering techniques, such as malspam, with a link to a malicious download.
The resulting download contained two payloads: one was a configuration file that contained a list of predetermined banks.
The other was a DLL file that could be injected into various processes to intercept outbound network traffic and as well as gather details within a web browser.
The first iteration of Emotet relied on corrupting the registry of a targeted devices, and it continues to do so as a method of evasion as any exfiltrated data is encrypted and stored in the registry.
Not only is this method highly effective in thwarting discovery, it allows the attackers to maintain persistence on the targeted machine due to the complexity of finding any indicators of compromise.
Emotet is part of a group that includes – and is loosely related to – the Bugat/Feodo/Geodo/Heodo/Cridex/Dridex malware banking families that have had their fair share of publicity over the span of several years due to their widespread and destructive campaigns.
Over the past several years, Emotet has also been seen distributing AZORult, IcedID, ZeuS Panda, and TrickBot.
Emotet has now gained the serious attention of the AV industry, law enforcement, and researchers alike for its ability to simultaneously include multiple malware families in its distribution syndicate.
For a malware campaign to be successful over the long term, malware authors have to continuously update its codebase and attack vectors on a regular basis to thwart detection and remediation.
This is akin to a full time job, and although we don't have any evidence to the inner workings of the criminals behind Emotet, it is evident that those behind these attacks treat it like a highly successful business, with a team of dedicated developers and project leaders, with the only difference being that it is an illegal criminal enterprise.
Because of the sheer number of attacks, along with the large footprint this current campaign has, it cannot be discounted that this group is being run with the precision of a well-disciplined criminal enterprise.
It is also possible that the developers and leaders behind this may have previously been professionals in the information security space, and may also have the backing of a criminal enterprise involved in nefarious lucrative activities in order to sustain and support such an endeavor.
This latest variant of Emotet is spread via automated social engineering techniques, primarily through email.
As previously reported by several vendors, Emotet hijacks and inserts malicious email into legitimate email threads to appear more trustworthy to the recipient.
It is not unheard of for email threads to suddenly change topics and Emotet utilizes that human penchant for going on tangents to change the subject to something else, perhaps an update to an outstanding invoice.
Contained within the body of one of these emails is a zip file attachment that contains an infected Word document (SHA-256: c58f07f84d6aae485416683e5515b39bc39349e69bc14629440e693da23d6c4d) with a malicious macro that calls PowerShell.
The Base64 encoded PowerShell command the downloads a payload located at one of the following destinations:
hxxp://www.eteensblog.com/2tgmnk/fJZIPCYV/ hxxp://www.palisek.cz/wp-includes/YtgJbWQNtJ/ hxxp://www.mnminfrasolutions.com/wp-admin/zeteXeJYC/ hxxp://abbasargon.com/wp-admin/sqhztj4_dzq3e-019802155/ hxxps://weiqing7.com/ex6/3r2js_ocgr3bew87-538460/
Once downloaded, the payload is saved as "%CSIDL_PROFILE%\897.exe" (SHA-256: 1d51d8e9ae1d67cb804fb28024b04969fd5888c3befece09547e5506ee946027).
This example is taken from a fairly new Emotet sample had been recently been compiled – as of the time of this writing – on Fri Oct 04 17:25:03 2019 GMT.
The file reaches out the to the following URIs:
hxxp://172.105.11.15:8080/img/window/ hxxp://91.121.116.137:443/child/ hxxp://80.79.23.144:443/site/between/add/merge
Emotet also practices operational security and uses custom REQUEST headers:
Referrer: hxxp://[IP address of C2 SERVER]/[dir1]/[dir2]/… DNT: 1
Do Not Track (DNT) was a proposed HTTP header field, since abandoned, which was designed to allow internet users to opt-out of tracking by websites that collected user data, including a user’s previous website visits and activity.
We aren't sure what the purpose of this is within Emotet, but it is perhaps an effort by the attackers to shield their activities and connections to their C2 servers, though we can’t be entirely certain.
The file then copies itself to different locations such as:
%CSIDL_PROFILE%\AppData\Local\msptermsizes\msptermsizes.exe %CSIDL_SYSTEM%\hanskds.exe
Afterwards, it may create a service under the name of "hanskds" with the following details:
name: hanskds display name: hanskds startup type: automatic description: Indexes the contents and properties of files on local and remote computers; provides rapid access to files through flexible querying language.
Another recently discovered Emotet file (SHA256: 9A0A40DAD123B16C404EB3B786E72AC8F3A4EBAF9E8A14682977C69FFF4F379E) exhibits similar behavior, and has a similarly recent compilation timestamp of Fri Oct 04 18:21:32 2019 GMT, which is only an hour after the first Emotet file described above was compiled.
Having two separate files makes sense for an attacker, as it provides a failsafe should the other file be detected, thereby improving their chances of another attempt at the infection routine.
Aside from the already mentioned C2 servers, others may also be called, including:
hxxp://190.108.228.48:990/symbols/free/img/merge/ hxxp://172.105.11.15:8080/child/enabled hxxp://91.121.116.137:443/taskbar/glitch/add/ hxxp://80.79.23.144:443/chunk/child/add hxxp://138.201.140.110:8080/site/img/add/merge/ hxxp://95.128.43.213:8080/xian/nsip/add/merge/ hxxp://190.228.72.244:53/stubs/sess/add/merge/ hxxp://185.94.252.13:443/usbccid/prep/add/merge/ hxxp://37.157.194.134:443/forced/ hxxp://45.79.188.67:8080/guids/attrib
Finally, we also observed the following Emotet campaign downloading Trickbot: [SHA256: 7c06d1f53ccc14d4548b595f7c9afddf07be9c7a799e7a55a671cdf95e27bdca], which also contains a similarly recent timestamp of Fri Oct 04 04:40:28 2019 GMT, suggesting this is also a fresh new campaign.
Looking at the IP address locations for the related attacks we observed, we can see that, for this specific campaign, Emotet’s footprint is worldwide and does not discriminate based on locale.

As outlined above, this specific global campaign only scratches the surface of Emotet, specifically with the samples analyzed and infrastructure observed by us.
This single campaign we’ve observed utilizes what is essentially a little over a dozen command and control servers located around the world.
Due to the sheer amount of uncountable number of samples, and network IOC’s seen on a daily basis by researchers and organizations tracking Emotet worldwide, there is no doubt that Emotet is one of the most impactful malware campaigns of our time.
What first started out as a “simple” banking Trojan has become not only one of the most dangerous and complex botnets of recent memory, but has also persistently evolved with the times to stay highly relevant.
Fortinet has AV coverage in place for all (16) samples observed in this campaign:
Malicious Word Documents
VBA/Agent.3862!tr.dldr VBA/Agent.NVE!tr VBA/Agent.F3D4!tr.dldr
Emotet
W32/GenKryptik.DUMV!tr W32/Packed.FVW!tr Malicious_Behavior.SB W32/Kryptik.GXIK!tr W32/GenKryptik.DVLJ!tr
