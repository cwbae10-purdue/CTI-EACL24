In an effort to provide more proactive protections in Fortinet products and to more effectively identify and defeat network threats, the Fortinet security research team works on discovering potential threats in popular products.
As a result, over the past year we have discovered 84 vulnerabilities that have been reported to their respective vendors as part of our responsible vulnerability disclosure process.
Fortinet protections against these discoveries were released to Fortinet products at the same time these vulnerabilities were reported to their vendors.
As a result, Fortinet products have been able to proactively protect Fortinet customersâ€™ networks and systems against zero-day attacks targeting these vulnerabilities long before vendor patches for them became available.
Of the 84 vulnerabilities we have discovered, vendors have patched 41 of them, 24 have been confirmed and are being patched by the vendors, and vendors are currently investigating 19 of them.
See the Figure 1 below.
