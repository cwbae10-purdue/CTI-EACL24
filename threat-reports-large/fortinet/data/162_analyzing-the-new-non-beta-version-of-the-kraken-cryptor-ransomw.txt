FortiGuard Labs Breaking Threat Research Report
FortiGuard Labs recently detected new versions of Kraken Cryptor Ransomware.
While the beta tag has been removed from its configuration, there are still numerous bugs in this ransomware, and the author is still continuously modifying its basic functions.
This ransomware variant is relatively new, only starting to spread this past August.
It is obvious that this ransomware is still under construction and that the author is continuing to add new methods to improve its functionalities.
However, when we analyzed recent samples, we found the these new versions of the malware are still too unstable to execute themselves.
They are still filled with coding bugs, and even have message box for debugging.
After encountering multiple unusable versions, we were finally able to obtain a functioning sample.
In this article, we will analyze the new “working” version of the Kraken Cryptor Ransomware, which is still under-construction and trying to be more stable.
For details on the basic behavior of this ransomware, you can check here to look at some information posted by McAfee last month for reference.
Version 2.1 Found with Multiple Bugs
We found the version 2.1 in early November, and soon we realized this is a bugged version that always finished its execution without infecting our test system.
The reason is not due to a new anti-analysis functionality in the sample, but simply because it checks for a nonexistent tag in its configuration.
This causes the function to always return false, forcing it to finish its execution with a suicide function call to remove itself.
After finding this bugged sample, we detected another sample labeled as version 2.1 just a few hours later with the bug we just mentioned removed.
However, this version included another bug where the offline installation functionality is disabled because of a logical exception handling bug in the function of obtaining geolocation.
This function connects to ipinfo.io/json to obtain the geolocation of the system.
If it fails to get a connection, it catches an exception and will not assign any value for the geolocation variable, resulting in reading configuration to fail.
As a result, this version is only runnable in an online environment.
Another interesting point is that it also includes a debugged exception message.
Interestingly, we found those MessageBox calls in the previous v2.07.
However, we found more MessageBox calls in v2.1.
Over the next few days, the author modified the Kraken Cryptor Ransomware source code multiple times and spread without removing its debugged message or even the nonexecutive bugs.
We also found that there are different support emails in its configurations within the same version, leading us to believe that it may be possible that those two samples were compiled by different authors.
We only found support email “middleeast[@]cock.li” in this sample, while the support emails in other samples we mention in this article are all “onionhelp[@]memeware.net”
Version 2.2 with HelloWorld!
Another new version was released soon after we analyzed those bugged 2.1 versions.
This updated version works fine, even though the offline installation functionality is still disabled.
All of the other functionality is nearly identical except for one interesting function that can be found at the beginning of the main function.
A HelloWorld!
Sample source code has now been dynamically compiled and executed.
The author is playing with the source code for fun.
Changing Functionalities After Version 2.1
Configuration changing
This new version also has a new configuration tag “partner” over version 2.1, which replaces the old tag “operate”.
We also found that the “beta” tag has been removed from the configuration part in version 2.1.
In version 2.07, it was configured as 1 in its configuration, which meant that it was still in beta version.
However, in version 2.1 it assigned the value 0 in its source for the API query string, which means this connection was not from the beta version.
Another change in it configuration is the “help_voice”.
Such configuration uses CScript to execute the created visual basic script file (.vbs), whose content is configured in the “API” tag.
After this script file runs, it speaks the text configured within the configuration.
The final change is the tag, “skip_directories”.
It tries to skip more directories to speed up its encryption phase.
In the following image we show the configuration changes between 2.07, 2.1, and 2.2.
The red square highlights the skipped directories in version 2.1.
In version 2.2, we also detected that “price” and “price_unit” have now been configured as USD, rather than BTC, which was in the previous version.
No more anti-smb and anti-rdp
In the next image, we show the much different the inside of the “module” tag is from version 2.04.
Configuration for “smb” and “rdp” in the anti-analyzing module is removed from version 2.07.
Originally in version 2.04, “smb” and “rdp” tags were used to block smb and rdp connections in the infected environment.
However, we cannot find those blocking functions in either version 2.1 and 2.2.
Suspicious SelfKill Check
We also found another interesting check in both of these new versions.
Kraken now checks for specific username, specific file, and even specific IP or country code.
If it meets the checks It will stop infecting the system and remove itself.
For example, the IP “104.207.76.103” listed here is an IP address be located in Naples, Italy.
Conclusion
Fortiguard Labs has discovered the lstest new version of Kraken Cryptor Ransomware, which has been under construction since August.
In this new version, there are bugs that cause the malware not to run or disable some previous functions found in older versions.
For example, the offline file encryption module is now disabled.
We also found that while the configuration file was modified, the main functionalities were not being modified heavily.
We even found that the author has removed the program’s “beta” tag, even though this ransomware is still a “beta” version as it contains numerous obvious bugs in its source code.
FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor the malware family.
