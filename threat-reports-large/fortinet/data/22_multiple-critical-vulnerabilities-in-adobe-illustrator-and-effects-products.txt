FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report
Affected platforms: Windows Impacted parties: Users of Adobe Illustrator 2020 versions 24.1.2 and earlier, Adobe After Effects versions 17.1 and earlier Impact: Multiple Vulnerabilities leading to Arbitrary Code Execution Severity level: Critical
This Tuesday (June 16, 2020), Adobe released out-of-band security updates to address 18 critical vulnerabilities in multiple products.
Seven of them were discovered by FortiGuard Labs researchers Honggang Ren, Kushal Arvind Shah, and Yonghui Han.
These vulnerabilities were discovered in Adobe’s Illustrator and After Effects solutions.
Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows.
The five vulnerabilities FortiGuard Labs discovered in Adobe Illustrator are identified as CVE-2020-9639, CVE-2020-9640, CVE-2020-9641, CVE-2020-9642, and CVE-2020-9575.
After Effects is a video-editing application developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows.
The two vulnerabilities FortiGuard Labs discovered in Adobe After Effects are identified as CVE-2020-9637 and CVE-2020-9638.
Due to the critical rating of the following vulnerabilities, we suggest users apply the Adobe patches as soon as possible.
Following are additional details of these vulnerabilities:
CVE-2020-9575
This Memory Corruption vulnerability exists in the decoding of SVG files in Adobe Illustrator.
Specifically, the vulnerability is caused by a malformed SVG file that causes an Out of Bounds memory access due to an improper bounds check.
This specific vulnerability exists in the ‘SVG’ plugin.
A remote attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application via a crafted SVG file.

FortiGuard Labs is committed to ongoing threat research and analysis to provide critical threat intelligence to our customers and the cybersecurity community.
The zero-day vulnerabilities outlined in this report are part of these efforts.
While FortiGate IPS customers already have updated IPS signatures for them in place, we strongly encourage all Adobe Illustrator and After Effects customers to apply these recently released patches as soon as possible.
FortiGuard Labs’ dedicated zero-day vulnerability research team was formed in 2006 as a white hat ethical hacking approach.
The goal of this program is to harden security by discovering zero-day vulnerabilities in software/hardware before black hat attackers do.
By beating attackers at their own game, FortiGuard Labs is able to provide virtual patch protection for discovered flaws ­– usually through IPS controls – before any patches are available.
FortiGuard Labs also has a robust responsible disclosure policy in place as part of our white hat ethical practice, meaning that any discovered zero-day vulnerability will be reported to the affected vendor(s).
By doing so, FortiGuard Labs has created strong relationships with vendors, enabling us to work together to close security holes and harden products through proactive research.
Unlike black hat or gray hat approaches of selling these vulnerabilities, FortiGuard Labs solely uses them to provide virtual patches to our customers using the Fortinet Security Fabric with FortiGuard subscription services.
