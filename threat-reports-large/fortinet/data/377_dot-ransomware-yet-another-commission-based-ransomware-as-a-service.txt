Dot ransomware is a new Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that is openly available in hacking forums.
And following the current trend in malware services, it uses web portals hosted in the TOR network for anonymity.
While lurking in hacking forums, we came across a post for this new ransomware service.
RaaS services are now switching from a one-time fee or subscription payment model to a commission based strategy.
One advantage of this scheme is that the up front price for the ransomware is free, and any profits realized are just split 50/50 between the author and affiliate.
This is an easy, no pressure gateway for aspiring affiliates since nothing is invested in obtaining the ransomware.

Visiting a Tor links directs potential affiliates to the Dot ransomware homepage.
The site itself is relatively new.
The ad shown in Figure 01, above, was posted on Feb 21 of this year, but the project was only launched a few days earlier, on Feb 19 (Figure 02.)
Recent updates to the site show that this RaaS variant has continued to receive support and refinements from the author in order to improve the product.

To start, an affiliate needs to register using a Bitcoin Address.

Once logged in, the malware builder can be downloaded, along with the core component, which is basically the payload itself with a default configuration.

In order for affiliates to track the number and status of infections, a statistics page is made available.
During our testing we found that the statistics only counts an infection as successful if the victim visits the decryption page.
This has the advantages of eliminating automated infections and providing a more realistic return from real victims.

The builder comes with a setup guide, although its usage is fairly straight-forward even without it.

To guide complete newbies in the intricacies of RaaS, the setup guide includes recommendations on prices for particular countries and includes also a list of 380 suggested file target extensions.
(Complete list of extensions is in the end of the article)
Country Code|Price(Bitcoin)
FR|0.15|FI|0.15|IE|0.15|IS|0.15|AU|0.15|BE|0.15|CA|0.15|AT|0.15|DK|0.15|SE|0.15|DE|0.15|NL|0.15|SA|0.2|US|0.2|HK|0.2|LU|0.2|CH|0.2|NO|0.2|AE|0.2|SG|0.2|KW|0.2|MO|0.2|QA|0.2
As previously mentioned, configuring the payload is pretty straight-forward.
The following features can be set in the builder.
Figure 07 Ransomware Builder
After setting up the necessary configurations and a generating a successful build, the DotRansomwareBuilder generates a Tracking ID that is unique for every build.
Figure 08 Build Ransomware
The configuration is then encrypted and written in the overlay of the payload binary, as seen below.
Figure 09 Encrypted-Decrypted Configurations
The decrypted configurations include the following data:
Configuration
Description
appID(Tracking ID)
{4 alphanumeric chars} - Unique for every build
bitcoinAddress
Bitcoin address of affiliate
defaultPrice
{1} – default price if not specified by the affiliate
partEncryption
{True/false} – encrypts only first 4MB of file
extensions
Target file extensions specified by affiliate
countries
Countries with special decryption prices
prices
Decryption price for specific countries set by the affiliate
After decryption of the configuration, it continues to decrypt the URL for the decryption and payment page unlock26ozqwoyfv.
This URL is hard-coded by the author and cannot be configured by the user.
To make sure that the URL has not been tampered with, it computes the SHA256 hash of the URL and compares it to a hard coded value.
This is to ensure that the payments go through the author first.
Only then will the user get paid, or at least hope to be paid.
Figure 10 Hardcoded SHA256 value
It does the same for the embedded RSA-4096 public key in the file.
It computes the SHA256 hash and compares it to a hardcoded SHA256 value.
This ensures that the private key on the C&C side will be able to decrypt the “Signature” that was encrypted by the hard-coded public key.
Figure 11 Decrypted RSA-4096 Key
Figure 12 Hard-coded SHA256 hash value
If the computed SHA256 hash is not equal to the hard-coded value, dot ransomware will terminate.
Since there is no network traffic during run time to notify the C&C, the Signature is important to differentiate between victims.
The link to the decryption page of the ransomware is appended by the signature and is unique for every victim.
Figure 13 URL for Unlock26 website
The unique Signature of the victim consists of the following data:
Signature
Description
key{38 bytes }
Randomly generated and used as key for encryption
iv{8 bytes}
Randomly generated and used as Initialization Vector(iv)
bitcoinAddress
Bitcoin address of affiliate
appID(TrackingID)
Unique for every build
country
Country of infected victim
price
Price set by the affiliate to decrypt files
partEncryption
True/false – encrypt only first 4MB of file
uniqueExtension
{3 char}
Randomly generated value appended to the encrypted filename
i.e.
.locked-{uniqueExtension}
After accumulating all the needed data for the Signature it is encrypted by the embedded RSA-4096 public key.
Some characters from the encrypted Signature are replaced from “+ to @”, “/ to –“ and “= to !” as added encoding.
The final output will serve as the unique Signature.
Offline encryption is gaining popularity since it causes minimal network traffic noise, thus, making it less suspicious.
The encryption used by Dot ransomware is Blowfish, a symmetric-key block cipher, and uses a randomly generated 38 bytes-length key alongside the 8 bytes initialization vector.
An initialization vector (iv) prevents repetition in data encryption, making it more difficult to find a pattern in the encrypted file.
Although the actual encryption for the file is a symmetric algorithm, the encryption key is encrypted using RSA-4096, which means that to be able to decrypt the files the private key is needed.
Infected files are appended by .locked-{3 random char}.
Figure 14 Encrypted files
After encryption, the ransomware opens the ReadMe HTML file , which shows the sites the victim needs to visit to get instructions for unlocking the files.
Taking a look at the unlock page, it is pretty straight-forward as only has one instruction, which is to pay.
However, there’s not much information on what happens after paying.
Usually, a decryptor application is given to the victim.

The simplistic and straight-forward design of Dot ransomware enables just about anyone to conduct cybercrime.
With all the support for bug fixes and developments, it’s astonishing to think that these malware services have evolved using traditional business models.
Moreover, it allows cyber criminals to easily start a RaaS business with the free additional safety of an online anonymity framework from Tor service and Bitcoin.
Although we haven’t seen this ransomware in the wild, with the advertisements being made accessible on hacking forums it’s only a matter of time until people start taking the bait.
