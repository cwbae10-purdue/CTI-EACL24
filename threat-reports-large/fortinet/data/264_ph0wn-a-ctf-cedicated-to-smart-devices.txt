We have organized a Capture The Flag event this week.
Codenamed Ph0wn, this CTF is really unique because it is dedicated to smart devices.
This CTF is free and takes place this Wednesday, November 29, 2017, starting at 6pm.
Traditional CTFs include challenges on standard infrastructures: PCs, servers, webservers, etc.
And from time to time, some CTFs feature hardware challenges.
(We should probably cite Hardwear.io CTF , and RHME3 for automotive.)
But, as far as we know, Ph0wn is the first CTF for IoT.
Without leaking any secrets, we can tell you this CTF will feature challenges on:
Drones

Smart glasses

Weather stations

IP Webcams, and more...
IP Webcams, and more...
We even have a washing machine :)
Again, this Capture The Flag event is free and takes place this Wednesday, November 29, 2017, starting at 6pm in Sophia Antipolis, France.
This event has been co-organized with local universities and research institutes, and is being followed with a free conference - e-SAME - the next day (Nov 30).
We want to shout out a special thank you to the Fortinet EMEA marketing team for all their support.
