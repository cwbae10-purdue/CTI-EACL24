The internet is a great source for information and entertainment.
But it is also rife with fraud schemes, scams, misinformation, and other tactics to exploit your personal and financial data.
Cybercriminals often focus on high-profile global events to find target victims in hopes of stealing their financial data.
These criminals target viewers using a variety of strategies.
Take for instance the current Rugby World Cup event currently being held in Japan.
Many fans can't make it over to Asia, so they turn to free streaming services or download sports applications to keep them up-to-date on their favorite team.
Unfortunately, free is sometimes too good to be true!
While exploring our FortiGuard Labs domains data feed, we found a suspicious site (rugbyworldcup.xyz) that did indeed advertise free live streaming of the World Cup.
Following the website links ultimately directed us to a potential scam site asking for credit card information.
What was supposed to be free, was not free any longer.
However, during our investigation of rugbyworldcup.xyz, we also visited one of its dynamic redirectors, sports99.club, and discovered more so-called free services for such things as free movies, music, and e-books.
We then employed our proprietary sequential log analysis on telemetry data and found a few more of these “free” services.
And when we tested them, we learned that they all share a common scheme:
Advertising sites that promote free services Watch/Download Free Movies Download Free E-books Watch Live Sports Free
Watch/Download Free Movies
Download Free E-books
Watch Live Sports Free
Advertising sites that link to one or more affiliate networks and directs the user to the so-called free service site
Free service sites (advertisers) ask users to create a free user account by providing an email address and password
Free service sites share newly entered user info with one or more external sites (sometimes transmitted in plain text!)
and then direct the user to the final account validation site
The account validation site prompts the user to enter their credit card information to “validate” their account.
The free account is not created until the user submits their credit card information
User reviews online indicate fraud because they subsequently find unauthorized credit card charges from these so-called free service companies
Here are a few of the suspicious sites we uncovered during our investigation.

As you can see, the lesson here is to be cautious of any free streaming website, it might be more than it seems.
Doing an internet search using ‘free streaming sites for rugby world cup’ elicited 110 million webpages.
Many of these sites are suspicious and likely contain malware.
Our advice is that if you must watch sports online, it is best that you purchase from a legitimate streaming service.
