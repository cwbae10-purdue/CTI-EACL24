FortiGuard Labs is committed to ongoing threat research and analysis to provide critical threat intelligence to our customers and the cybersecurity community.
The zero-day vulnerabilities outlined in this report are part of these efforts.
While FortiGate IPS customers already have updated IPS signatures for these vulnerabilities in place, we still strongly encourage all Adobe customers to apply these recently released patches as soon as possible.
FortiGuard Labs’ dedicated zero-day vulnerability research team was formed in 2006 as a white hat team with an ethical hacking approach.
The goal of this program is to harden security by discovering zero-day vulnerabilities in software/hardware before black hat attackers do.
By beating attackers at their own game, FortiGuard Labs is able to provide virtual patch protection for discovered flaws—usually through IPS controls—before any patches are available.
FortiGuard Labs also has a robust responsible disclosure policy in place as part of our white hat ethical practice, meaning that any discovered zero-day vulnerability is reported to the affected vendor(s).
By doing so, FortiGuard Labs has created strong relationships with vendors across a variety of industries, enabling us to work together to close security holes and harden products through proactive research.
Unlike black hat or gray hat approaches of selling discovered vulnerabilities, FortiGuard Labs solely uses them to provide virtual patches to our customers using the Fortinet Security Fabric with FortiGuard subscription services.
FortiGuard Labs continues to lead the industry in zero-day discoveries through this program.
To date, we have discovered and reported over 900 vulnerabilities—from the endpoint to the cloud—broadly covering the attack surface.
