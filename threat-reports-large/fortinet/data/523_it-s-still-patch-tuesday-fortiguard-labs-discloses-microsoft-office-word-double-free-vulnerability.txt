Overview
From the Yes, You Really Should Upgrade Department, FortiGuard Labs has discovered a third Microsoft Office Vulnerability that is rolled into today's Patch Tuesday updates.
For a bit of variety, this is a double free vulnerability in Word 2007 and 2010.
The vulnerability occurs when Word fails to validate that a pointer was already released before attempting to release it again, causing conditions that attackers could leverage to achieve remote code execution scenarios.
The underlying problem involves an internal structure that gets released without resetting the address to NULL.
This causes Word to release the pointer twice on certain resource consumption cases when it is running out of memory.
That's where the variety ends, however, as this vulnerability exists due to an error while the vulnerable software attempts to open a specially crafted Microsoft Word file.
And yes, it could lead to remote code execution.
Analysis
Mitigation
All users of Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010 are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of this software.
Additionally, organizations that have deployed Fortinet IPS solutions are already protected from this vulnerability with the signature MS.Office.WWLIB.Pointer.Handling.Memory.Corruption.
