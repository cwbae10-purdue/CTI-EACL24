Previously, we talked about a new ransomware-as-a-service called Encryptor RaaS.
Encryptor RaaS is a GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) compiled ransomware that is available to anyone who wishes to be a spreading affiliate.
The author then takes 20% commission for each ransom paid by an infected victim.
While monitoring, we noticed some updates on its website.
In particular, the new version of the ransomware dated November 13, 2015, caught our attention so we decided to take a look.
Currently, the website looks as follows:
Figure 1.
Updated Encryptor RaaS website
We can see some changes compared to the previous advertisement such as the new comment box and the author’s contact details ("jeiphoos").
The website currently indicates a total of 317 infections.
If this is true, it means that Encryptor RaaS has started to attract affiliates.
It is also worth mentioning that we have seen some forum posts from users infected by this ransomware.
The author's commission seems to have dropped to 5% as opposed to 20% previously, which may have contributed to attracting more affiliates.
But what are the updates to the binary itself?
Digital Signature
According to the website, the ransomware is now digitally signed by stolen Authenticode certificates.
We have confirmed this upon downloading a demo binary from the website.
Below is a screenshot of the certificate:

Persistence
The author has added some persistence mechanisms such as dropping the following autorun registry:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
{random} = ""{malware path and filename}" /SkipReg"
This allows the malware to execute and encrypt files every time the system restarts.
It adds the “/SkipReg” parameter to the registry which signals the malware not to re-register itself on the C&C.
The malware registers itself during the first execution by uploading the affiliate ID and the affected machine’s GUID.
The malware also attempts to find the “Windows Task Manager” window periodically:

Code to find Task Manager window
Once found, it calls SendMessage API with the WM_CLOSE parameter to terminate the window:

Code to disable Task Manager
This prevents the user from terminating the ransomware process via the Task Manager.
Target File Types
The list of target file extensions has significantly increased.
From 233, there are now 590 target files including backup file formats.
A complete list of targeted files appears at the end of this post.
Bypassed Files
Aside from wallet.dat, the malware now avoids encrypting electrum.dat.
“Electrum.dat” is a Bitcoin wallet file generated by the Bitcoin client "Electrum":

Of course, it also avoids encrypting its readme file “readme_liesmich_encryptor_raas.txt” which is a slightly different filename from the previous readme version.
The ransomware message remained the same, still written both in English and German, although the decryptor site has now changed to 5jua3omslrbkks4c.onion.link.
Shadow Copy Deletion
Finally, the most notable update to the ransomware is that it now attempts to delete Shadow Copies.
Shadow Copy is a Microsoft Windows feature that allows the operating system to back up files.
The ransomware deletes Shadow Copies by silently executing a DOS command:
Figure 6.
Code to delete Shadow Copies
This routine effectively renders the user unable to recover files from Windows backup.
Who is behind Encryptor RaaS?
The TOR- and Bitcoin-based operation of Encryptor RaaS makes it hard to track the author behind this ransomware.
On top of that, the author uses the dark web mail service SIGAINT to talk to clients.
We found that a thread was created in the forum evilzone.org regarding our previous Encryptor RaaS post.
A user with the handle jeiphoos has replied to the thread and identified himself as the author of Encryptor RaaS.
One of his replies to the thread suggests that he has been or is around many German-speaking people:
Figure 7.
Forum post of jeiphoos on evilzone.org
Additionally, his forum profile shows that his local timezone is Central European Time, which is Germany's timezone.
Therefore, it is possible that the author is located in Germany or in one of the countries under the CET timezone.
Conclusion
The new changes found in the Encryptor RaaS illustrate the author's determination to succeed in the RaaS business.
While the author's claimed infection count is low as of the moment, the continuous development of the ransomware and the now lower commission percentage may continue to attract more affiliates.
All in all, RaaS is a serious threat.
It provides a convenient platform for cyber extortion and a big headache to its victims.
It is important to monitor RaaS services, along with prominent ransomware families, for developments to keep solutions relevant and customers protected.
We will continue to post information on this blog as we unfold new developments in the ransomware landscape.

Hat tip to my colleague Tien Phan for helping to create the IPS signature Encryptor.RaaS.Botnet to detect updated Encryptor RaaS C&C communication.
