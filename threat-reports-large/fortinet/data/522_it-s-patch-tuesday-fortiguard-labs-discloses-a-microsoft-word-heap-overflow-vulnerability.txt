Overview
Microsoft Office is the most popular productivity suite in the world, first released by the Redmond software giant in 1988.
Microsoft releases updates and patches for its software, including Office, on what is now commonly known as Patch Tuesday (the second and sometimes the fourth Tuesday of each month).
Today, Patch Tuesday includes not one, not two, but three vulnerabilities discovered by researchers at FortiGuard Labs.
The first is a heap overflow vulnerability Microsoft Word 2007.
Although it was released eight years ago, Office 2007 remains widely used and falls under Microsoft's Extended Support until April 2017.
This particular vulnerability could lead to remote code execution.
