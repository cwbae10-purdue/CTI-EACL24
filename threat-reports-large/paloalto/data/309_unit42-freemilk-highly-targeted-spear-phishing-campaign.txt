In May 2017, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified a limited spear phishing campaign targeting various individuals across the world.
The threat actor leveraged the CVE-2017-0199 Microsoft Word Office/WordPad Remote Code Execution Vulnerability with carefully crafted decoy content customized for each target recipient.
Our research showed that the spear phishing emails came from multiple compromised email accounts tied to a legitimate domain in North East Asia.
We believe that the threat actor hijacked an existing, legitimate in-progress conversation and posed as the legitimate senders to send malicious spear phishing emails to the recipients as shown below in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Conversation Hijacking to Deliver Malware
Upon successful exploitation, the malicious document delivered two malware payloads PoohMilk and Freenki.
The targeted victims in this campaign we identified include:
a bank based in the Middle East
trademark and intellectual property service companies based in Europe
an international sporting organisation
individuals with indirect ties to a country in North East Asia
In past activity that we believe is linked to this same threat actor, dissidents and others were also likely targeted.
We named this campaign “FreeMilk” after the words found in the malwares’ PDB path string.
The threat actor leveraged Microsoft Word CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability which is popularly used in both targeted and non-targeted attacks at present.
The malicious document sends out the following beacon to a compromised website server as shown in Figure 2.

Malicious Word document callback beacon
The C2 server responds with a Base64 encoded PowerShell script which in turn downloads two fake image files that contain embedded PE binaries and a JavaScript file which extracts the embedded PE binaries onto the victim host as shown in Figure 3.
The extracted PE payloads are what we label as PoohMilk and Freenki.
