Since the discovery of the Mirai variant using the binary name ECHOBOT in May 2019, it has resurfaced from time to time, using new infrastructure, and more remarkably, adding to the list of vulnerabilities it scans for, as a means to increase its attack surface with each evolution.
Unlike other Mirai variants, this particular variant stands out for the sheer number of exploits it incorporates, with the latest version having a total of 71 unique exploits, 13 of which haven’t been seen exploited in the wild until now, ranging from extremely old CVEs from as long back as 2003, to recent vulnerabilities made public as recently as early December 2019.
Based on this seemingly odd choice, one could risk a guess that the attackers could potentially be aiming for the sweet spots of IoT vulnerabilities, targeting either legacy devices that are still in use but probably too old to update due to compatibility issues and newer vulnerabilities that are too recent for owners to have patched.
The newly incorporated exploits target a range of devices from the usually expected routers, firewalls, IP cameras and server management utilities, to more rarely seen targets like a PLC, an online payment system and even a yacht control web application.
This version first surfaced on October 28th, 2019 for a couple of hours, after which it was taken down.
It then resurfaced on the 3rd of December, switching payload IPs and finally adding 2 more exploits that weren’t in the samples from October.
While details on this version were recently published, this post shares CVE numbers (where available) for the vulnerabilities targeted, as well as IOCs for this version I have been tracking since October.
The following section also explains the discrepancy in the exploit count used here in comparison to other publications.
This latest variant contains a total of 71 unique exploits, 13 of these vulnerabilities haven’t been previously seen exploited in the wild prior to this version.
Exploits targeting the same vulnerability in different devices (potentially sharing firmware) or targeting different ports have been grouped together.
The exploits that are new to this version, and any previously seen Mirai variant for that matter, are listed in Table 1 below:
