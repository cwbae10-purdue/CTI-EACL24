Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered two new critical Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerabilities affecting IE versions 9, 10, and 11.
Both are included in Microsoftâ€™s July 2016 Security Bulletin, and documented in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-084.
In our continued commitment to the security research community, these vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft through our participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) program, which ensures the timely, responsible disclosure of new vulnerabilities and creation of protections from security vendors.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research.
Our researchers have discovered more than 80 critical Microsoft vulnerabilities over the past 20 months and also been recognized for contributions to Adobe, Apple and Android vulnerability research.
By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with vendor such as Microsoft for patching, we are removing weapons used by attackers to compromise enterprise, government and service provider networks.
