Last week we hosted the first ever Unit 42 Twitter chat with several of our Unit 42 experts, including Ryan Olson (@ireo), Jen Miller Osborn (@jadefh), Robert Falcone (@r0bf4lc), and Bryan Lee (@obiwanblee).
The chat, “Sure Things and Long Shots, A Look at the 2016 Threat Landscape,” tackled questions from the biggest shifts in the threat landscape to the most effective measures to protect against those threats, and the best ways people can protect themselves in 2016.
The #PANWchat also served as the official launch of the new @Unit42_Intel Twitter handle, which moderated yesterday’s chat.
Make sure to follow @Unit42_Intel for the latest from our Unit 42 team.
Take a look at some of the highlights from the chat below or catch up on the entire conversation through the #PANWchat hashtag.
And be sure to check out our ongoing series of predictions for 2016!

A2 You’ll see more APT groups start putting the “A” in APT as the media coverage increases and people are more security aware #PANWchat

A2 Modular Trojans + obfuscation/packing = le sigh…increased LOE for analysis and decreased threat attribution #panwchat

A3 Patching remains one of the most basic, yet best, ways to avoid a compromise #PANWchat

A3 Backup.
Get Owned.
Wipe.
Repent.

A3 Implementation of simple policies such as restricting exe downloads macro docs can be highly effective #panwchat

A8 Your passwords are probably your biggest weakness.
New Years Resolution: Get a password manager!
#PANWchat
— Ryan Olson (@ireo) December 17, 2015
A8 Pay attention to the security, or lack of, anything touching the Internet.
Be an informed consumer.
Also, password managers #PANWchat

A9 I hope for more data sharing and fewer fluff blogs.
Descriptions of tactics are great, but actionable data is king.
#PANWchat
— Ryan Olson (@ireo) December 17, 2015
A9 Cross-vendor intel exposes prev unk overlaps of threats.. More intel dissemination = More linkages = More threat coverage #panwchat
— Robert Falc (@r0bf4lc) December 17, 2015
A9 Threat research is key for the security part of “cybersecurity”.
More and better sharing is critical – no more IOC hoarding!
#PANWchat
— Jen Miller Osborn (@jadefh) December 17, 2015
@ireo Completely agree, adversaries share attack data, why shouldn’t we?
