We’re proud to announce the launch of our new threat intelligence portal, a dedicated place for Unit 42 research and discoveries.
We designed this space to give the security community a new way to engage with so much of our important threat intelligence content.
Here’s what you can expect to see:
Our streamlined navigation should help you better find the threat content that is most relevant to you.
Our improved categories should enable you to quickly choose between reports, threat briefs, multimedia, and popular content.
We’ve improved our search and simplified the sorting to help make it easier to discover new research.
Our in-site search returns research more effectively than external search engines by focusing just on Unit 42 research content.
Visitors can preview research right from the search results page and filter content by author and topic.
Adversary playbooks are an important part of our work and it’s integrated into our new site for easier access.
Our Adversary Playbooks capture and organize the complete collection of tools, techniques, and procedures that specific adversaries use to achieve their goals.
Read more about playbooks here or watch a this video here.
View some of the malware reversing and decryption tools we use to investigate how malicious programs work and what they’re engineered to do.
Because we believe all threat intelligence should be shared freely, we’ve made these tools publicly available on GitHub.
Let us know what you think about the new portal in the comments section or share your thoughts on Twitter @Unit42_Intel.
