As part of Unit 42â€™s ongoing threat research, we can now disclose that Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers have discovered ten vulnerabilities addressed by the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) as part of their October 2018 APSB18-30 security update release.
Palo Alto Networks customers who deploy our Next-Generation Security Platform are protected from zero-day vulnerabilities such as these.
Weaponized exploits for these vulnerabilities are prevented by Traps multi-layered exploit prevention capabilities.
Threat prevention capabilities such as application control, IPS, and WildFire provide our customers with comprehensive protection and automatic updates against previously unknown threats.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research in Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Google Android and other ecosystems.
By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing the information with the security community, we are removing weapons used by attackers to threaten users, and compromise enterprise, government, and service provider networks.
