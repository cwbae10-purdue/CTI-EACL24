Black Hat USA 2014 kicks off next week, and along with our product and solution experts, you’ll meet team leads from Unit 42, the Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence team.
Last week we celebrated the official launch of Unit 42, along with the release of 419 Evolution, a new report examining the evolution of Nigerian actors that had previously been active launching 419 scams and are now targeting businesses with more sophisticated techniques.
Download a copy of the report to understand the tools and infrastructure used in their attacks, as well as how to protect your critical assets.
Unit 42 leads will be available at our Booth #227 to take your questions and talk about our intelligence process.
And while you’re at the booth, you’ll see demonstrations and visualizations, including an in-depth look into recent high-profile exploits and a first-of-its-kind integration between network and endpoint security.
You’ll also have a chance to chat with our onsite recruiters and enter for a chance to walk away with a GoPro and other great prizes.
