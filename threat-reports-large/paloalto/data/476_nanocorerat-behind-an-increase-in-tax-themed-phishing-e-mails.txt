It seems every mainstream news event or holiday has an accompanying phishing campaign.
Opportunistic actors hoping to capitalize on the public’s attention are often seen sending phishing e-mails with themes related to the news or the season..
It happened this last holiday season and will likely continue to occur as long as email is around.
Unsurprisingly, as we near the U.S. deadline for filing our income taxes, Palo Alto Networks researchers have seen an increase in phishing emails specifically related to taxes.
This blog details some recent trends we have been able to identify.
Palo Alto Networks noticed both executable attachments and Microsoft Word documents with macros designed to download and execute files.
Looking through recent email attachments determined to be malicious by WildFire, we noticed a trend in subject lines involving tax forms using the keywords ‘report’, ‘tax’, ‘secure’ and ‘pin’.
Pivoting from subject lines to the hash values and filenames of attachments included in the emails allowed us to expand our initial sample set.
Finally, using the AutoFocus API and a bit of Python we were able to collect data about the samples included in the tax-themed phishing and build a data frame for further analysis.
Within the final sample set, we were able to identify 70 unique malware samples distributed through 2,062 email sessions between September 2, 2015 and January 28, 2016.
As expected, email sender addresses were often spoofed to provide a sense of legitimacy.
Some examples of email sender addresses:
2015-autax-return@ato.gov.au
2015Refund@cra-arc.gc.ca
2015autaxreturn@ato.gov.au
2015tax-return@irs.gov
2015taxreturn-noreply@irs.gov
2015taxreturn@iras.gov.sg
We also noticed the source IP address of the emails primarily came from a free mail service called mail2world.
The top 5 source IP addresses by session count were:
209.67.128.221 934 sessions
117.120.5.194 214 sessions
209.67.128.182 213 sessions
23.235.221.158 63 sessions
130.194.13.86 53 sessions
While some of the phishing email attachments were PE files, others were MS Word documents with malicious macros.
One sample (119f3dd48e316f77974a7ec84c0fdecd943ceed77c30db9a6df0c1b0615b0ac0) included instructions on how to enable macros.
Using open source tools, the obfuscated file download functionality is easily located in the Word macro.
Looking at the malware contained in each email attachment, the payloads consisted predominantly of NanoCoreRAT or a generic macro downloader that would then download and execute NanoCoreRAT.
The countries receiving these phishing messages align with what are believed to be country code indicators in malicious URLs and email attachment names.
Recipients of Tax-Based Phishing E-mails
Analyzing the malicious macro documents we observed for these tax-themed phishing attacks revealed that although there were a large number of unique samples, their behavior and infrastructure contained significant overlap.
In the above figure, we can easily see that six domains were in heavy use by most samples.

NanoCoreRAT Command and Control:

NanoCore is a commodity trojan developed in the .NET framework.
According to Symantec, a fully cracked version of NanoCore 1.2.2.0 with premium plugins was released around March 2015 and has been seen targeting the energy sector.
This release caused NanoCore to become increasingly popular with adversaries, especially the more frugal ones.
Around April 2015 we observed a rise in activity involving NanoCore.
We have observed its incorporation into tax-themed phishing since June 2015 and are continuing to see a general increase in activity since then.
Below shows the upward trend Palo Alto Networks has seen in NanoCoreRAT being distributed since September 2014.
NanoCore is a modular RAT with many of its capabilities provided through plugins.
Capabilities provided by the premium plugins we could identify include:
keylogging and password “recovery”
“stress testing” or DoS
download, execute, or install other software
remote CLI and UI
registry editing
socks proxy
firewall modification
webcam and audio controls
The plugins available to a NanoCoreRAT sample are encrypted and stored in the resource section of the PE file.
Using dnSpy as a debugger, we extracted the plugins included in sample 758f255abc102d53b7a4e8a8902da57076db9889cb80e81e8f1a344056f00c59 by setting breakpoints on all Assembly.Load calls, running the sample, and manually dumping the raw assembly bytes passed to those functions to disk as DLLs.
Most of the plugins included in this sample were obfuscated with Eazfuscater.NET 3.3 and easily deobfuscated using de4dot.
NanoCoreRAT uses a custom TCP protocol to connect to a server specified by the attacker on the port of their choosing.
Below is the encrypted traffic sent by one sample to 54.152.254.8 on TCP port 4782:
This sample uses DES to encrypt the traffic.
It creates DESCryptoServiceProvider with a key from the Assembly Resource Guide Attribute and bytes from the resource section.
The DES key for this sample is 72 20 18 78 8C 29 48 97, we can use it to decrypt the traffic into the following:
00 00 00 00 12 DD DF 82 E7 AE 59 ED 45 B3 F4 E2 B5 7D 53 A5 EE 0C 14 57 49 4E 2D 48 55 46 44 39 33 41 52 36 32 32 5C 6A 6F 68 6E 0C 07 44 65 66 61 75 6C 74 0C 07 31 2E 32 2E 32 2E 30 …..Ýß‚ç®YíE³ôâµ}S¥î..WIN-HUFD93AR622\john..Default..1.2.2.0 System Guid ComputerName\Username RAT Group Version
The bytes are stored in array2 and are encrypted with the following code and stored in the byte array named buffer.
NanoCore can output messages to a console if the EnableDebugMode parameter is enabled in the RATs configuration.
Phishing is often how threat attackers gain access to targeted systems and user awareness is the first line of defense.
Phishing isn’t new but the increased distribution of the full-featured NanoCoreRAT implants is.
Users should be made aware of the dangers that enabling macros poses.
We have observed macro-based attacks on the rise in October of 2014
Palo Alto Networks customers with WildFire turned on would have been alerted to the presence of this threat on their networks.
AutoFocus customers are able to further research both tax-themed phishing and NanoCoreRAT samples and trends.
