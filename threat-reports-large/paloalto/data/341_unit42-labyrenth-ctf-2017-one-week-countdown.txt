We’re one week away from the launch of the second LabyREnth Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge!
It’s time to give all you players some more details on what you’re going to see next week.
We’ve got five tracks this year, and they’re a little different from last year.
The skills we’ll be focusing on this year are the following:
Working with binaries (PE files, ELF files, Mach-O files, etc.)
Working with documents (MS Office Files, PDF Files, etc.)
Working with Mobile and IOT files (iOS, Android, ARM, MIPS, etc.)
Understanding the Threat Landscape (Yara, Networking, Intel, etc.)
Programming
While you’re in the LabyREnth, look out for some other challenges hidden throughout the CTF.
Complete them quickly and you could win one of our individual first to solve prizes (tablets, VR equipment, etc.).
Or just finish challenges in the five tracks to win some of the $32,000 in cash prizes we’re giving away this year!
The overview, rules, and most importantly prize structure can all be seen at http://labyrenth.com.
We’ve selected these tracks and challenges as we believe they form the cross-section of skills necessary to be a solid security researcher.
We’ll be revealing hints and more information about the challenges throughout the CTF.
The countdown clock to the launch is running at http://labyrenth.com.
We look forward to seeing you at 4pm PST on June 9!
