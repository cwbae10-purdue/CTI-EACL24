Unit 42 researchers found that public cloud infrastructure has communicated with domains known to distribute COVID-19 themed malware.
On March 24, 2020, Unit 42 published a blog discussing attack patterns used by malicious actors in relation to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).
Taking these findings a step further, researchers attempted to uncover if there are malicious COVID-19 related events taking place within public cloud infrastructure.
If indications of this activity were found, how could organizations protect themselves?
Researchers identified 300+ COVID-19 themed malware samples that communicated with 20 unique IP addresses and domain indicators of compromise (IOCs).
After querying Prisma Cloud for network connections to these 20 suspicious IOCs between March 1 and April 7, 2020, researchers found a total of 453,074 unique network connections across 27 unique cloud environments (see Image 1).

Clear indications of communication with nodes known to perform command and control (C2) operations related to COVID-19 themed malware
It is not clear if each of the 27 identified organizations were in fact compromised with COVID-19 themed malware, as researchers were not able to view the network traffic nor did they receive the malware samples themselves which initiated the witnessed connections.
Nonetheless, these network connections should be considered highly suspicious due to the fact that the destination endpoints have a documented history of malware operations.
Using AutoFocus, a Palo Alto Networks proprietary tool for malware-based threat intelligence research, Unit 42 researchers queried for malware samples that established network connections to domains that contained at least one of the following keywords: “Corona”, “COVID”, “Pandemic”, or “Virus”.
Researchers then filtered the results based upon timestamps between March 1 and April 7, 2020.
The metadata of these network connections was then analyzed and compared to the network traffic Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud maintains.
CAVEAT: Given the nature of network traffic, the network traffic content was not available for analysis, leaving only the network connection’s metadata as a sole means to identify malware network traffic.
AutoFocus returned more than 446 malware samples fitting COVID-19 themed domain network connections.
These samples provided 20 unique domains and hard-coded IP addresses that could potentially serve or maintain the malware infrastructure.
By resolving the domains to the most recently known host IP address, these IP addresses were used to query cloud network traffic connections between March 1 and April 7, 2020.
The query returned 453,074 unique network connections from cloud environments, which were communicating to systems directly tied to the DNS activity of known COVID-19themed malware, see Image 1 above.
Table 1 lists the 18 IP addresses, which were identified within Prisma Cloud as well as what and if they are maintained by a content delivery network (CDN) provider.
Table 1.
Total COVID-19 themed malware sample DNS activity samples queried through Prisma Cloud
The yellow highlighted values indicate IP addresses that resolve to CDN hosting platforms like Cloudflare, Level 3, and Akamai Hosting.
CDN networks provide limited network information outside of session metadata.
Given this limitation, researchers chose to exclude CDN IP addresses from this analysis no matter the likelihood of malicious content.
Unit 42 also published the blog COVID-19: Cloud Threat Landscape which details CDN website hosting within cloud platforms.
Researchers were able to positively identify seven IP addresses that were witnessed as the destination network connection from 27 unique Prisma Cloud environments.
These IP addresses resolve to independently hosted, non-CDN web servers, which have a known history of malicious activity both from the perspective of Unit 42 and from other reputable third-party threat sources like RiskIQ’s PassiveTotal and Hyas Insight.
These seven IP addresses, and the domains from which they resolve, significantly increase the likelihood that they serve or maintain malicious content directly associated with COVID-19 themed malware and they are actively communicating with cloud environments, see Table 2.
Table 2.
Non-CDN hosted domains and their associated Prisma Cloud network connections
Image 1 displays the network traffic percentages witnessed by these seven IP addresses.
Researchers returned to AutoFocus to refine the malware sample results of these IP addresses.
Researchers specifically targeted any malware sample that contains DNS activity with any IP address that is listed in Table 2.
The results returned a total of 185 unique malware samples with an assortment of connections to known malware families and exploits like LokiBot, NanoCoreRAT, vulnerability exploits CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2017-0199, and CVE-2012-0158, as well as having several connections to malware operations like Windows Word phishing documents and RTF_ASLR bypass.
While these malware families and exploits appear to have DNS activity linking them to these seven IP addresses, researchers are not suggesting that there exists any link with COVID-19 themed malware and these malware families or exploits outside of their IP infrastructure or DNS activity.
For example, it is possible these particular systems could host and provide several variants of malware and it is also possible that more than one malicious group hosts and maintains their own C2 operations on one or more of the systems using the IP addresses in Table 2.
Additionally, each of these seven IP addresses was flagged as “Blacklisted by Third Parties” within PassiveTotal’s RiskIQ based upon the grounds of phishing, spam, C2 infrastructure, and malware distribution.
With the AutoFocus evidence paired with the evidence gathered from RiskIQ’s PassiveTotal and Hyas Insight, researchers feel highly confident in determining these IP addresses as malicious and recommend that no cloud or traditional environment maintain any network communication with them.
Researchers also analyzed the network sessions to determine the protocols most commonly used by the IP addresses listed in Table 2.
As can be seen from the network traffic metadata, shown in Table 3, TCP Port 80 and TCP Port 443 make up 97% of the network traffic to and from these malicious IP addresses, although there are suspicious connections present on ports 25, 110, and 445.

Destination port analysis of suspicious COVID-19themed network communications
For the remainder of this blog, the following four IP addresses will be specifically isolated as they hold the highest likelihood for serving or maintaining malicious COVID-19 themed content to cloud infrastructure, 74.208.236.42, 31.170.167.123, 5.79.72.163, and 51.77.161.45.
The IP address 74.208.236.42 comprised the majority of the network connections with 97% of the non-CDN traffic originating from cloud environments.
This IP address is the sole resolution for the domain unlimitedimportandexport.com, which is flagged for malicious content regarding command and control infrastructure, malware distribution, and phishing operations using COVID-19 themed attacks.
AutoFocus contained 15 malware samples that perform network connections to the domain unlimitedimportandexport.com and it’s resolving IP address 74.208.236.42, with a first seen date between March 1 and April 7, 2020.
AutoFocus had tagged each of these malware samples as either ExcelLaunchPowerShell (12) or WinwordLaunchPowershell (7).
No other domain was identified resolving to this IP address from any other AutoFocus samples.
While the domain is not the only site hosted upon the system residing at 74.208.236.42, this IP address is to be considered highly suspicious and likely delivers malicious content to cloud environments.
Unit 42 released a blog on April 12, 2020, detailing Malicious Attackers Target Government and Medical Organizations With COVID-19 Themed Phishing Campaigns.
Within that report, the IP address 31.170.167.123, which resolves from the domain www.tempinfo.96.it, was identified as the C2 node used to receive the username and hostname from the victim organization, which was then used to generate an AES encryption key.
This encryption key is then returned to the victim by means of an HTTP POST from the URL www.tempinfo.96.lt/wras/savekey.php, and the encryption process is initiated.
This IP address was found to have network communications with three organizations within the Prisma Cloud network metadata.
However, the organizations involved were not government or medical organizations, as they were detailed within the previous Unit 42 blog, but rather included a US-based business data and analytics firm, a US-based market analysis firm, and a US-based network analytic company.
This IP indicator should be considered highly suspicious and all network communications with it should initiate an incident investigation.
The IP address 5.79.72.163 was witnessed interacting with six of the 27 disparate cloud environments.
The IP address resolves to the domain teknik.io, which maintains a firm history of malicious actions including malware distribution operations.
No other domain has been seen resolving to this IP address and any connections to this IP address should be considered suspicious.
AutoFocus contains 143 malware samples, associated with this domain and the resolving IP address, with a first seen date between March 1 and April 7, 2020.
The vast majority of these malware samples were tagged as exploiting CVE-2017-11882 (130) or CVE-2017-0199 (21), with a couple of samples also tagged as LokiBot (10) and NanoCoreRAT (4).
The malware appears to center around Windows operating systems and focuses on Rich Text File documents to infect systems.
All network traffic to or from this domain and its resolving IP address should be considered highly suspicious and efforts should be made to terminate future network connections.
The IP address 51.77.161.45 has been linked to COVID-19themed malicious content via the domain kplico.com.
This domain has been put on third-party denylists due to malware distribution and phishing attempts, and the system only appears to host-specific domains at specific times.
These domains appear to rotate across 16 predominately Iranian-based domains
Analysis of the malware samples gathered from AutoFocus only consisted of three positive malware samples first seen during the March 1 through April 7, 2020 timeframe used for this research, tagged as CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2017-0199, and WinwordLaunchPowershell, however, there have been a total of 11 confirmed malware samples since January 27, 2020.
All known malware samples make DNS requests to the domain kplico.com and Autofocus tags the majority of the older samples as NanoCoreRAT (6).
Of the 300+ malware samples identified to communicate with known COVID-19 related malware, 20 unique IP addresses and domains were identified.
Network traffic from all known Prisma Cloud environments was queried using these 20 suspicious IP addresses and domains and a total of 453,074 unique network connections were identified between March 1 and April 7, 2020, see Image 1 above.
Of these network connections, seven IP addresses were identified, which gave a high likelihood of positive malware communications with cloud infrastructure.
These communications are highly likely to contain malicious transmissions to and from infrastructure known to host COVID-19 related operations.
It is not clear if each of the 27 identified organizations was in fact compromised with COVID-19 themed malware, as researchers were not able to view the network traffic nor did they receive the malware samples themselves which initiated the witnessed connections.
It is critical that every organization monitor their cloud infrastructure network communications to ensure that these types of malicious communications are identified and blocked.
CNSP methodologies must be integrated into cloud infrastructure, development, and production environments to ensure these COVID-19themed attacks cannot be maintained within a cloud infrastructure.
Each of the IOCs listed within the following IOC section were added to the PAN-DB, which will allow each next-generation firewall, both hardware and VM-Series, to block network traffic to the identified IP addresses and domains, as well as block any of the malware samples listed within the report.
Prisma Cloud has taken its first steps into integrating AutoFocus Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) into its operation base to ensure that cloud organizations can quickly identify when their cloud infrastructure communicates with known malicious malware.
Now that Prisma Cloud combines AutoFocus with its ability to monitor cloud endpoints, detect malicious actions, and alert upon critical vulnerabilities, Prisma Cloud is able to monitor and protect single, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments using proven threat intelligence.
Integrate Cloud Native Security Platforms (CNSP) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that cloud infrastructure is properly vetted for security risks.
CNSPs share context about infrastructure, PaaS, users, development platforms, data and application workloads across platform components to enhance security.
CNSP offers organizations the ability to deliver secure cloud infrastructure while simultaneously using the hallmarks of cloud, security automation, secure scalability, manageability, and secure on-demand resourcing.
Every Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) template used within both development and production environments should be scanned for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities prior to its use.
According to the Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report: Spring 2020, more than 42% of all IaC templates pulled from GitHub contain at least one misconfiguration or vulnerability.
