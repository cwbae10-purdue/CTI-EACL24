Palo Alto Networks researcher Hui Gao was credited with the discovery of a new critical Microsoft vulnerability affecting Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9, 10 and 11.
This vulnerability is covered in Microsoftâ€™s March 2016 Security Bulletin and documented in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-023.
In our continued commitment to the security research community, these vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft through our participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) program, which ensures the timely, responsible disclosure of new vulnerabilities and creation of protections from security vendors.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research and have discovered more than 80 critical Microsoft vulnerabilities over the past 20 months.
By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with Microsoft for patching, we are removing weapons used by attackers to compromise enterprise, government and service provider networks.
