The end of May 2018 has marked the emergence of three malware campaigns built on publicly available source code for the Mirai and Gafgyt malware families that incorporate multiple known exploits affecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Samples belonging to these campaigns incorporate as many as eleven exploits within a single sample, beating the IoT Reaper malware, which borrowed some of the Mirai source code but also came with an integrated LUA environment that incorporated nine exploits in its code.
In their newest evolution, samples also target the D-Link DSL-2750B OS Command Injection vulnerability, only a few weeks after the publication of its Metasploit module on the 25th of May (even though the vulnerability has been public knowledge since February of 2016).
While exploring samples belonging to one of these campaigns, I also discovered they support several new DDoS methods previously unused by Mirai variants.
This blog post details each campaign (in the chronological order they were observed) along with the exploits used, the new DDoS methods supported, ending in a comparative summary of the campaigns.
Also covered is the tangential discovery of some Gafgyt samples incorporating new Layer 7 DDoS functionality targeting a known DDoS-protection provider.
IOCs for different campaigns, if not mentioned under the corresponding section, can be found at the end of this blog post.
CAMPAIGN 1: An evolution of Omni In May 2018, the Omni botnet, a variant of Mirai, was found exploiting two vulnerabilities affecting Dasan GPON routers â€“ CVE-2018-10561 (authentication bypass) and CVE-2018-1562 (command injection).
The two vulnerabilities used in conjunction allow the execution of commands sent by an unauthenticated remote attacker to a vulnerable device.
Since then the same family has evolved to incorporate several more exploits, detailed in Table 1.
I used the sample below for this analysis
