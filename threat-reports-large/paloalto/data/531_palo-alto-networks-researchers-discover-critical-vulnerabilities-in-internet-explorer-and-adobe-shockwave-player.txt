Palo Alto Networks researchers have been credited with discovery of new vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Shockwave Player and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Palo Alto Networks researcher Tongbo Luo discovered a critical vulnerability in Adobe Shockwave Player affecting Shockwave versions 12.1.9.160 and earlier for Windows.
The vulnerability and upgrade instructions are detailed by Adobe in a Security Bulletin dated September 8, 2015.
Palo Alto Networks researcher Bo Qu discovered three new critical Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerabilities affecting IE versions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
Each is included in Microsoftâ€™s September 2015 Security Bulletin, and documented in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-094.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research.
Previous critical IE vulnerability discoveries from the past 18 months included two in July, three in June, three in May, one in March, five in February (revised from three), three in November 2014, one in October 2014, 15 in September 2014, three in August 2014, 10 in July 2014, and 22 in June 2014 (revised from 21).
By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with Microsoft and Adobe for patching, we are removing weapons used by attackers to compromise enterprise, government and service provider networks.
