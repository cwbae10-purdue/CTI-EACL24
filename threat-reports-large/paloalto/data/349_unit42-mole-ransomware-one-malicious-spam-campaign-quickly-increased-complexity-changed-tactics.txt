On April 11th 2017, we saw a new malicious spam campaign using United States Postal Service (USPS)-themed emails with links that redirected to fake Microsoft Word online sites.
These fake Word sites asked victims to install malware disguised as a Microsoft Office plugin.
This campaign introduced a new ransomware called Mole, because names for any encrypted files by this ransomware end with .MOLE.
Mole appears to be part of the CryptoMix family of ransomware since it shares many characteristics with the Revenge and CryptoShield variants of CryptoMix.
The campaign quickly changed tactics and increased complexity.
After two days on April 13, 2017, the attackers behind these fake office plugins changed the format and began including additional malware.
Along with Mole ransomware, victims would be infected with both Kovter and Miuref.
Then, on the following day, April 14, 2017, the attackers stopped using a redirect link in the malicious spam and instead linked directly to a fake Word online site.
Figure 1 shows the attackers’ changing tactics from Tuesday April 11, 2017 through Friday April 14, 2017.
Figure 1: Changing tactics April 11 – April 14, 2017
From Tuesday April 11th to the early hours of Wednesday April 12th, the fake Word Online used Google Docs links to provide Mole ransomware disguised as an Office plugin.
Criminals behind this campaign abused Google Docs to provide a link for an executable file.
File names were plug-in.exe or plugin.exe.
Figure 2 shows how these fake Microsoft Word Online documents would attempt to lure users into downloading the Mole ransomware.
Figure 2: Fake Microsoft Word Online site with link to a Google Documents URL with the ransomware.
After downloading the executable, the infection chain is straight-forward.
The victim executes the ransomware and infects his or her Windows computer.
The mechanics behind a Mole ransomware infection have already been covered at the Internet Storm Center (ISC) and Bleeping Computer.
Figure 3 shows the April 12 Mole ransomware in action.

By Thursday April 13, 2017, this campaign changed tactics.
The fake Microsoft Word Online sites no longer used a Google Docs URL to provide their malware.
Instead, the malware was sent as a zip archive directly from the compromised site being used as a fake Microsoft Word Online page.
The zip archives contained JavaScript (.js) files designed to infect Windows computers with Mole ransomware and additional malware.
The Figures 4 and 5 below illustrate the newer format used for malware infections by this campaign, where the new file is a zip archive named plugin.zip that contains a .js-based downloader named plugin.js.
Figure 4: Fake Microsoft Word Online site later on April 13th with link to a zip archive instead of an executable
Figure 5: The zip archive contains a .js file
The plugin.js is a type of file downloader commonly called a Nemucod.
This .js file downloads and installs three Windows executable files named exe1.exe, exe2.exe, and exe3.exe as shown below in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Plugin.js installing 3 items of malware as shown in a reverse.it analysis
Network traffic generated by this infection is similar to Nemucod downloaders we have seen from other campaigns.
In Figure 7 below, you can see URLs for exe1.exe, exe2.exe, and exe3.exe from forum-turism.org.ro.
Figure 7: Traffic from an infection filtered in Wireshark
The three items of follow-up malware are named exe1.exe, exe2.exe, and exe3.exe.
In the early days of this campaign, they have been Mole ransomware, Kovter, and Miuref, respectively.
Figure 8: An example of the malicious spam from Thursday April 13th
Emails from this campaign follow the same format as originally reported from Tuesday April 11, 2017.
Figure 8 above shows an example email.
They have a variety of subject lines, spoofed sending email addresses, and message text.
Through Thursday April 13, 2017, the URLs were different for each message.
By Friday April 14th, these emails were linking directly to the fake Microsoft Word Online pages, so the URLs for that day were the same.
Most large-scale malicious spam campaigns tend to stick with operating patterns that are much easier to identify and track.
This particular campaign has evolved more quickly than we usually see.
Such changing tactics are likely a way to avoid detection.
And this campaign continues to evolve.
By Tuesday April 18, 2017, it stopped distributing Mole ransomware, and it began pushing the KINS banking Trojan with Kovter and Miuref.
By Friday April 21, 2017, this campaign moved from USPS-themed emails to messages about speeding tickets, and it began utilizing a fake parking services website.
Why did we stop seeing Mole ransomware?
Because families of ransomware are constantly changing.
CryptoMix variants like Mole rarely stay around for more than a few weeks before being repackaged and distributed as a new variant.
The samples of Mole ransomware we have identified so far are tagged in AutoFocus using the MoleRansomware tag.
We will continue to investigate this activity for applicable indicators to inform the community and further enhance our threat prevention platform.
