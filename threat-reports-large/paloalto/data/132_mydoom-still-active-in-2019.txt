MyDoom is an infamous computer worm first noted in early 2004.
This malware has been featured in top ten lists of the most destructive computer viruses, causing an estimated $38 billion in damage.
Although now well past its heyday, MyDoom continues to be a presence in the cyber threat landscape.
While not as prominent as other malware families, MyDoom has remained relatively consistent during the past few years, averaging approximately 1.1 percent of all emails we see with malware attachments.
We continue to record tens of thousands of MyDoom samples every month.
The vast majority of MyDoom emails come from IP addresses registered in China, with the United States running a distant second.
These emails are sent to recipients across the world, mostly targeting high tech, wholesale, retail, healthcare, education, and manufacturing industries.
This blog tracks MyDoom activity in recent years and focuses on trends during the first six months of 2019.
MyDoom’s method of propagation is through email using SMTP.
We compared emails containing MyDoom attachments with emails containing any type of malware attachment.
In the four-year period from 2015 through 2018, an average of 1.1 percent of malicious emails contained MyDoom.
When reviewing individual malware samples during the same period, MyDoom held an average of 21.4 percent for all individual malware attachments seen through malicious emails.
Why is the percentage of MyDoom emails so much lower than the percentage of MyDoom attachments?
Because many malicious email campaigns carry the same malware sample across messages to hundreds or thousands of recipients.
MyDoom is polymorphic and tends to have different file hashes for each of the emails we find.
Therefore, while the number of MyDoom emails is relatively low, the number of samples is comparatively higher when compared to other malware distributed through email.
Table 1 contains the statistics for 2015 through 2018.

The first six months of 2019 for MyDoom activity reveals a similar average compared to all of 2018, with a slightly higher percentage of both emails and malware samples.
See Table 2 for details.

574 MyDoom samples appeared across more than one month, so the total number of MyDoom malware samples in Table 3 below is different than the total of MyDoom samples in the six-month period taken as a whole in the previous table.

Where have these emails come from?
IP addresses of the top ten countries we saw during the first six months of 2019 were:
China: 349,454 emails
United States: 18,590 emails
Great Britain: 10,151 emails
Vietnam: 4,426 emails
Republic of Korea (South Korea): 2,575 emails
Spain: 2,154 emails
Russia: 1,007 emails
India: 657 emails
Taiwan: 536 emails
Kazakhstan: 388 emails

Countries that MyDoom emails have appeared from during the first six months of 2019.
Targeted countries were more varied and evenly distributed than the source countries.
Top ten targeted countries were:
China: 72,713 emails
United States: 56,135 emails
Taiwan: 5,628 emails
Germany: 5,503 emails
Japan: 5,105 emails
Singapore: 3,097 emails
Republic of Korea: 1,892 emails
Romania: 1,651 emails
Australia: 1,295 emails
Great Britain: 1,187 emails

Targeted countries of MyDoom emails during the first six months of 2019.
The top ten verticals hit during this period were:
High Tech: 212,641 emails
Wholesale and Retail: 84,996 emails
Healthcare: 49,782 emails
Education: 37,961 emails
Manufacturing: 32,429 emails
Professional and Legal Services: 19,401 emails
Telecommunications: 4,125 emails
Finance: 2,259 emails
Transportation and Logistics: 1,595 emails
Insurance: 796 emails
These results are skewed likely towards our customer base.
However, this data indicates that China and the United States are the source of most MyDoom emails and rank highest as the most targeted countries.
MyDoom distribution has had similar characteristics for years now.
In February 2019, Cylance analyzed a sample of MyDoom, and current MyDoom samples follow similar characteristics.
Emails distributing MyDoom are generally disguised as reports that an email was not delivered, with subject lines such as:
Delivery failed
Delivery reports about your e-mail
Mail System Error – Returned Mail
MESSAGE COULD NOT BE DELIVERED
RETURNED MAIL: DATA FORMAT ERROR
Returned mail: see transcript for details
However, we also frequently see MyDoom emails with random alphabetic characters in the subject line.
MyDoom emails also use other subject lines like:
Click me baby, one more time
hello
Hi
say helo to my litl friend

Attachments from these MyDoom emails are executable files, or they are zip archives that contain executable files.
MyDoom malware turns an infected Windows host into a malicious spambot, which then sends MyDoom emails to various email addresses.
This will happen even if the infected Windows host does not have a mail client.
Another characteristic of MyDoom is attempted connections to various IP addresses over TCP port 1042.

On a Windows 7 host, MyDoom makes a copy of itself in the user’s AppData\Local\Temp directory as lsass.exe, but the malware is not made persistent in the Windows registry.
On a Windows XP host, the MyDoom executable makes a copy of itself at C:\Windows\lsass.exe and is made persistent through the Windows registry in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive with a key named Traybar at SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run as shown in Figure 13.

First seen in 2004, MyDoom is still active today– a testament to its original destructiveness.
Enough infrastructure has remained infected throughout the years that we continue to see MyDoom in today’s threat landscape.
Although a relatively small percentage of malware-based emails contain MyDoom, this malware remains a constant presence.
Based on our data, MyDoom-infected infrastructure resides at IP addresses mostly belonging to China, with the United States running a distant second.
Both China and the United States are the primary recipients of MyDoom emails, although the distribution remains global and targets many other countries.
High tech is the most frequently targeted industry.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from MyDoom by our threat prevention platform which easily detects this malware.
AutoFocus users can track MyDoom attempts by using the MyDoom tag.
Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
CTA members use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt malicious cyber actors.
