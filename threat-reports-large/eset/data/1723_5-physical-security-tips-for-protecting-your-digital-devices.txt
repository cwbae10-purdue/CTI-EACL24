As we read earlier this week, the chances that one or more of your digital devices may get stolen are uncomfortably high.
So what would happen if your mobile device falls into the wrong hands?
Here are a few tips that will help minimize the damage if it happens to you.

So what would happen if your mobile device falls into the wrong hands?
Here are a few tips that will help minimize the damage if it happens to you.
While it sounds obvious, if anyone steals your device they will have to defeat your password to get at your data and accounts, which will significantly slow attackers.
Although it is not impossible to defeat password protection on a digital device, it adds a useful layer of protection, buying you time to locate and recover the device.
Why?
Even if you can’t recover a stolen device that does not mean you have to lose all your information and software.
Regular backups are the ultimate defense against theft of your files.
There are plenty of options for backup these days including online backup.
(Here’s an example of an online backup service.)
My colleague David Harley has written about backup here on the blog and here is a link to Aryeh Goretsky’s white paper on the subject (.pdf).
Taking the time to setup backup really pays off if a device is stolen, helping reduce the pain involved in re-creating the sensitive content.
Why?
Getting your stolen device back is not impossible, particularly if the device itself can tell you where it is and you can communicate with it using a sort of “remote control” via SMS or other methods.
You may even be able to communicate with the person who has it.
(Here’s an example of how one piece of anti-theft software for PCs.)
Why?
Leaving your computer or mobile device unattended in a car, airport or restaurant is akin to asking for it to be stolen.
In a recent survey we found that 1 in 5 stolen devices were taken from a car, 12% from an airport, train, bus, or other public transportation, and 11% from a restaurant or coffee shop.
(Here’s an example of anti-theft software for Android devices.)
Why?
Storing sensitive data in encrypted files prevents anyone exploiting your data if your computer is stolen.
Note: File encryption is available free on recent version of both the Microsoft Windows and apple Mac OS X operating systems.
This step is a lot easier than it used to be, so the pain level is low these days (unlike in years past).
Why?
Your computer may interact with sensitive data but it does not need to store all of it right there in one place.
Consider using encrypted removable media for sensitive data and carrying that separate from the computer.
