We recently blogged about Securing Our eCity San Diego and MyMaine Privacy both being selected as winners for the Best Local/Community Plan with respect to cyber-security.

It just makes sense to want to have peers who are that good when you’re fighting cybercrime and trying to help educate people.
Does this make sense to you?
Imagine you are in a war.
Of course you want to be the best at what you do, but do you want the person helping you in the fight to be less effective than you or would you rather have as many of “the best” as possible.

Cyber-security is going to take a lot of work to make significant progress and it really is encouraging to see other grassroots efforts springing up and being effective.
