As you'd expect, there have already been reports of Black Hat SEO (Search Engine Optimization) being used to lure people looking for news of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami onto sites pushing fake AV.
(Stop me if you've heard this before…) My colleague Urban Schrott, however, offered some pretty good advice on what to look out

My colleague Urban Schrott, however, offered some pretty good advice on what to look out for on the ESET Ireland blog even before I started to see reports of actual abuse.
I recommend that you take a look at his blog, but I hope he won't mind if I reproduce his short but to-the-point list of things you shouldn't do:
DO NOT click on social media and email “shocking news” or “shocking video” links.
DO NOT go to untrusted websites for news.
