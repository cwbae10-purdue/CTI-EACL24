Just six percent of British employees have received training in dealing with phishing attacks, a survey has revealed.
Just six percent of British employees have received training in dealing with phishing attacks, a survey has revealed.
The study, undertaken by YouGov and funded by Blue Coat, assessed the behavior of 1,186 UK employees across telephone, email and social media.
It discovered that little has been done to prepare them for phishing – one of the more commons social engineering attacks utilized by cybercriminals.
In fact, just 18 percent of respondents had received any kind of IT security training, and only 10 percent of those described said training as ‘regular.’
Perhaps more interestingly, Information Age notes a gender gap in terms of the success of hacking attacks.
While just 36 percent of men had set up privacy settings on their social media accounts, 52 percent of women had taken these steps.
This is important, as sharing ‘too much information’ publicly can be a gift to cybercriminals – learning basic information about targets can be used to reset passwords, which can then be used to compromise valuable business assets.
However it wasn’t exclusively men who were to blame for less effective security precautions.
While 12 percent of the women surveyed used their pet’s names to generate online passwords, the habit was mirrored by just five percent of male respondents.
Elsewhere, however it was age, rather than gender that predisposed risky behaviors in social media.
