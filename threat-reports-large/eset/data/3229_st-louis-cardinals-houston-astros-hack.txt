The St. Louis Cardinals, one the United States’s top major league baseball teams, is being investigated for allegedly hacking into the computer systems of sporting rivals.
According to claims first made public in a New York Times report, evidence has been uncovered that Cardinals staff broke into a network belonging to the Houston Astros, and accessed a database containing sensitive information.
Information held in the database (known as Ground Control) is said to have included internal conversations about trades, statistics and scouting reports.
To be honest, the news of a hack doesn’t come as a complete shock.
Last year, sports blog Deadspin reported that 10 months’ worth of Astros’ internal chatter about trades had been published on the internet, after an unknown party managed to access Ground Control.
