A push-button function on many wireless routers designed to bypass the Wi-Fi password and provide quick access to the network could allow attackers to break in in “one second”, reports have claimed.
A push-button function on many wireless routers designed to bypass the Wi-Fi password and provide quick access to the network could allow attackers to break in in just “one second”, reports have claimed.
The Wi-Fi password flaw was found by Swiss security firm Oxcite, and allows hackers to bypass the security of Wi-Fi Protected Setup almost instantly, according to Engadget’s report.
Rather than making thousands of guesses at the PIN code, the attackers make one guess, based on offline calculations.
“It takes one second,” Dominique Brongard of Oxcite said.
“It’s nothing.
Bang.
Done.”
The attack is the latest in a series of weaknesses uncovered in popular models of routers – and affects routers using a chipset made by Broadcom and another , as yet unnamed, manufacturer.
In both cases Oxcite claims, it would take roughly “one second” to guess the hotspot’s PIN code.
The attack relies on poorly generated “random” numbers, and is not inherent to WPS itself, just the (as yet undisclosed) router models.
The researchers believe, however, that the Wi-Fi password security flaw is relatively common, and advise users to switch off the WPS function (done from any router’s set-up page) until the problem is known to be solved.
Research has shown that many popular router models ship with known Wi-Fi password vulnerabilities among others, which activist group Electronic Frontier Foundation attributes to the relatively low price of the devices, and the difficulty of budgeting for proper security updates.
