Apple has released its first patches of 2010 and if you are running Snow Leopard I recommend you apply the patches.
Apple users have the distinct advantage of Windows users of predominantly being ignored.
Despite the fact that playing a malformed audio file can cause arbitrary code execution (which means your Mac is vulnerable to malicious code), not too many people are interested in exploiting the vulnerability.
A lot of hardcore Mac fans point out that there are no viruses for Snow Leopard.
Viruses are less than 5% of the malicious threats we see in the Windows world.
There is malware that runs on Snow Leopard, it just doesn’t self-replicate.
An important thing for businesses to remember is that a hacker who wants to target an individual business can exploit vulnerabilities.
It really isn’t about viruses, keeping your system up to date is a good security practice no matter what operating system you use.

Normally configured OS X systems will update automatically.
