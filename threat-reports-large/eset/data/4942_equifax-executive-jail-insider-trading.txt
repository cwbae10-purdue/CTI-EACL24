“Sounds bad”, the former Equifax CIO wrote in a text after learning of the breach that ended up affecting almost half the US population
The Equifax debacle is in the news again, as a former executive of one of the firm’s business units was sentenced to four months in prison last week for capitalizing on early knowledge of the massive security incident two years ago, according to a press release by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).
Jun Ying, the former Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Equifax’s US Information Solutions division, pled guilty back in March to selling his shares in the credit bureau.
He admitted to dumping his stock after becoming aware of the breach but before it was disclosed a week and a half later.
This ultimately earned him the prison sentence, which was imposed last Thursday, as well as a fine of US$55,000.
He was also ordered to pay restitution worth some US$117,000 and the prison time will be followed by a year of supervised release.
