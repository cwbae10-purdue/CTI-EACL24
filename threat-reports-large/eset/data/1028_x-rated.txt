If you open Adobe Reader or Acrobat and go to the help menu, select “about”.
This is where it tells you the version you have installed.
I am not sure what Adobe will do to make it more clear after they update Adobe X.
Right now it simply says “Adobe X” and not what version of Adobe X as they are on the first version.
