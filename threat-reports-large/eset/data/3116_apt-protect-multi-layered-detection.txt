Advanced persistent threats (APT) are a growing concern to the world’s companies and networks.
In a 2014 study by ISACA, about 1 in 5 respondents reported that their enterprise had already been victimized by an APT, but more than three times that number said they “believe that it is only a matter of time before their enterprise is targeted.”
I recently presented a webinar on APTs and gave an overview on how they work.
I presented real-world data breaches resulting from APTs and also looked at how multi-layered proactive detection can combat this threat.
My co-presenter, Don Lewis, followed up with an overview of how ESET’s endpoint solutions respond to APTs.
I hope you find this webinar helpful.
