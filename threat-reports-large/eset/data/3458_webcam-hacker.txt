A hacker who used the notorious Blackshades RAT malware to hijack webcams on computers, and secretly watch people engaged in sexual activity, has received a suspended prison sentence.
A hacker who used the notorious Blackshades RAT malware to hijack webcams on computers, and secretly watch people engaged in sexual activity, has avoided prison.
Stefan Rigo, of Leeds in the United Kingdom, was said to have voyeuristically observed his victims – over half of whom were personally known to him – for between five and 12 hours each day, seeing everything they did in front of their computer.
12 hours a day?
That sounds like a dangerous addiction to me.
Rigo could have probably done with some more Vitamin D in his diet through a dose of sunlight.
Rigo’s unhealthy obssession saw him spy upon individuals, some while they were using Skype to have private, intimate chats with other users.
In addition to observing his victims through their hijacked webcam, Rigo was also capable of stealing passwords from infected computers, reading email conversations, launch denial-of-service attacks, access banking data and so forth…
Rigo was arrested in November 2014, as part of an international operation rounding up hackers suspected of remotely hijack other people’s computers.
According to local media reports, Rigo had used an ex-girlfriend’s banking details to purchase the Blackshades malware – perhaps not the wisest choice for someone intending to avoid identification…
With the court taking Rigo’s guilty pleas counts of voyeurism and offences under the Computer Misuse Act earlier this year into account, the 34-year-old was given a 20 week suspended sentence and will be placed on the sexual offenders’ register for seven years.
