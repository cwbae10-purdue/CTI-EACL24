My good friend Righard Zwienenberg received one of these emails claiming that Jacques Tits wanted to register his company’s name.
You can read of his experiences at http://norman.com/Virus/Blog/righard_zwienenberg/56117/en-us.
I just had a little fun with the scammers.
Righard strung them along for a while.
It is an interesting read complete with email exchanges.
