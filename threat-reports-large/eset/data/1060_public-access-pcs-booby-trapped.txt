…keyloggers were found to have been attached to PCs used by members of the public…
The incident involves a couple of public libraries in the Manchester area of the UK (Wilmslow and Handforth, to be precise), where keyloggers were found to have been attached to PCs used by members of the public.
One of the devices disappeared before it could be confiscated, so if you use either of those libraries for PC access, you might want to check that accounts and sites you've accessed haven't been compromised.
