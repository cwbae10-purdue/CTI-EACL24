ESET Ireland’s Urban Schrott has found an Ireland-targeted 419 with a Spanish twist.
Perhaps it's some kind of link left over from all those ships from the Spanish Armada that found themselves making landfall on the West Coast of Ireland, or maybe it's an obscure allusion to the beleaguered Eurozone, but my colleague Urban Shrott passed on to me a spate of rather unusual lottery spams.
You may be familiar with similar examples of this style of 419 reading like this (an example quoted by Urban in his blog.

(Juan Carlos?
Is the Spanish monarchy that short of cash?)
However, the fascinating twist here is that the scammers went to the trouble of translating the message into Gaeilge (Irish Gaelic), though I can't vouch for the quality of the translation.
Cheers, Urban.
