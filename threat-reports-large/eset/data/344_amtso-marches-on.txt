After a very pleasant evening spent with ESET’s partners in Budapest, we were back in the same room, in many cases with the same people, for another meeting of the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO).
A great deal of progress was made: in particular, papers on sample validation and testing “in the cloud” products were approved by the members present, as was a document defining the procedures associated with the work of the Review Analysis Board.
Those should be available on the newly re-vamped web site soon.
Some useful work was done on some of the other papers still in progress, and some new documentation projects were discussed and initiated.
This week, Randy and I are in Berlin for EICAR, where we are presenting a paper on execution context in testing.
