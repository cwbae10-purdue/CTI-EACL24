ZDNet reports that a temporary restraining order to disable the website hosting StealthGenie was issued by a federal judge in the Eastern District on Virginia was issued on 26 September.
The app was available for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry, and required physical access to the handset to install it, meaning its apparent intention was to monitor the activities of people connected to those who downloading the app.
Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell issued a statement condemning the app, and explaining the arrest: “Selling spyware is not just reprehensible, it’s a crime.
Apps like StealthGenie are expressly designed for use by stalkers and domestic abusers who want to know every detail of a victim’s personal life – all without the victim’s knowledge.
The Criminal Division is committed to cracking down on those who seek to profit from technology designed and used to commit brazen invasions of individual privacy.”
