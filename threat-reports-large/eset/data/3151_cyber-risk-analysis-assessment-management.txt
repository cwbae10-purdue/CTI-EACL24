Risk analysis is the first step towards managing risks, particularly when it comes to cyber risks.
This recorded webinar introduces and explains key concepts, with links to several useful risk assessment tools.
Information technology brings many benefits to a business, but it also brings risks.
Knowing how to assess and manage those cyber risks is essential for success, as well as a a powerful hedge against many of the threats that your business faces, whether you are an established firm or a pioneering startup.
In this recorded webinar I introduce the basics of risk analysis and the core concepts involved in assessing your organizationâ€™s cybersecurity.
During my research in preparation for this webinar I gathered together links to several free risk assessment resources you might want to check out, particularly if you are exploring this aspect of security for the first time.
