Sometimes it seems that we are fighting a battle that we are destined to lose.
To some extent, win or lose depends upon your definition of the terms.
We have never completely beat crime, but we still have victories against criminals… sometimes.
Today it is a very great pleasure to wish a happy 6th anniversary

Today it is a very great pleasure to wish a happy 6th anniversary to the tremendous folks at CastleCops and their very dedicated volunteers.
Paul and Robin Laudanski are some of the most wonderful people anyone could ever hope to meet (I hope to meet them some day).
Their work to help internet users has been inspiring.
Despite the most worthless dregs of humanity, the type that beat 90 year old women with sticks because that is as brave as those cowards can get, trying to shut down the CastleCops site, CastleCops is up and running and doing wonderful work for the community.
It is truly the successes of Jedi’s like the CastleCops community that keeps hope alive for the rest of us fighting the dark side of the force!
