An article for Virus Bulletin by David Harley reviews two eBooks offering security advice to consumers.
I’ve recently posted* an article that was originally published in the February 2014 issue of Virus Bulletin.
It’s a review of two eBooks that were published (fairly) recently and that aim to provide security guidance for consumers on how to avoid malware and other threats.
In accordance with the policy of Virus Bulletin, which holds the copyright for the article, here’s a copyright notice:

The books in question are Improve Your Security by Sorin Mustaca, and One Parent to Another by Tony Anscombe.
A brief summaryof the review is that they’re both well worth considering if you’re looking for that kind of publication, but they’re quite different in scope and intent.
The long version is – well, quite a lot longer.
:) But it’s good to see people who actually have a track record in anti-malware writing about it.
