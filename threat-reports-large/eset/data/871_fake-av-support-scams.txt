I’ve been banging on various forums for a while about the misuse of the ESET brand (among others) by fake support centres cold-calling victims and telling them they have “a virus” and charging them hefty fees to fix the “problem.”
I've been banging on various forums for a while about the misuse of the ESET brand (among others) by fake support centres cold-calling victims and telling them they have "a virus" and charging them hefty fees to fix the "problem."
I first came across the problem in June when a researcher from another security company brought a specific incident to my attention, and I blogged it here.
Subsequently, acting on information from my friend Steve Burn, I was able to add a little more information and lots of links here.
Steve and I, and my colleagues at ESET UK have been exchanging information.
There's an update in my latest article for Security Week.
Meanwhile, the Guardian, whose earlier article was cited in my second blog, has also returned to the theme here and here.
