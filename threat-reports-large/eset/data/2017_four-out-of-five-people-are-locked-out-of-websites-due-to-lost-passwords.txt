Four out of five consumers have been “locked out” of websites due to not remembering log-ins – and over a fifth rely on password resets “on a regular basis,” according to a survey conducted by Ping Identity.
Four out of five consumers have been “locked out” of websites due to not remembering log-ins – and over a fifth rely on password resets “on a regular basis,” according to a survey conducted by Ping Identity.
The survey, of 1,000 computer users in the UK, highlighted the problems in expecting consumers to remember long, complex passwords, and negotiate difficult log-in processes.
Nearly a quarter of consumers now remember log-ins for up to five consumer websites (24%) and almost a third of shoppers remember log-ins for up to 11 and 20 websites according to Ping’s research.

“With more than half of respondents logging into an online shopping site with a password up to five times a day, this login barrier could cost businesses dearly,” said Andrew Hindle, director at Ping Identity.
“E-tailers need to make the registration and payment process as seamless as possible.”
Nearly 71% of consumers admitted to having “abandoned” web businesses due to having been forced to fill in long, complex web forms, according to Ping’s survey.
The need to remember up to 20 different passwords and usernames highlights why so many users re-use passwords, or use simple variations on existing ones.
