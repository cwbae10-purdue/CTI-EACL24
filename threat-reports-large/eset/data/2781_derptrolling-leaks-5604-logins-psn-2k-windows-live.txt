Hacking group DerpTrolling has leaked 5,604 logins for three gaming networks to Pastebin, and claims that this is a “very small portion” of the credentials they have stolen, LifeHacker reports.
The leak was announced by the one of the hacking group to his 40,900 followers today with a seemingly innocuous comment:”We will just leave this here.” A Pastebin link with over 5,500 login credentials followed.
“Dear Internet,” the Pastebin entry begins, “the following is a very small portion of Lord Gaben and the rest of his crews glorious raids across the high seas of the Internet.” The introduction then explains that the leak contains a selection of ‘2k Gaming studio user credentials’ (2,000), ‘PlayStation Network user credentials’ (2,131) and ‘Windows Live Email user credentials’ (1,473).
Speaking to CNET, a member of the group claimed that the data leaked to Pastebin was a small selection of a much bigger selection, stating, “We have 800,000 from 2K and 500,000 credit card data.
In all of our raids we have a total of around 7 million usernames and passwords.
We have around 2 million Comcast accounts, 620,000 Twitter accounts, 1.2 million credentials belonging to the CIA domain, 200,000 Windows Live accounts, 3 million Facebook, 1.7 million EA origins accounts, etc.”
The Independent reports that some of the logins contained on the document appear not to work, which suggests the leak could be out of date.
