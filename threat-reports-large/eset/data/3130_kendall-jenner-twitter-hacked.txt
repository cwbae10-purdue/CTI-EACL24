Twitter hackers hit the account of TV reality star Kendall Jenner, posting tweets about her father and Justin Bieber.
Kendall Jenner is the latest member of the Kardashian Klan to have suffered at the hands of hackers.
When a celebrity starts to post crazy things on Twitter there are a small number of possibilities.
Either they are just seeking some attention, tweeting things without thinking, or they have been hacked.
The problem is that when it comes to publicity-seeking celebrities, often it’s hard to decide what is most likely.
Many times it’s tricky to tell the difference, and although a celebrity might later claim that they have been hacked – it’s hard to know if that’s just being used as an excuse for some ill-advised tweeting.
And sometimes it’s just a lame April Fool’s joke.
But in the case of Kendall Jenner, I think we can be fairly confident that her account was hijacked by an unauthorised party.
