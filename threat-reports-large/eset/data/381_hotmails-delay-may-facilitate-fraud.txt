If you google “I"m sorry that i didn’t inform you about my traveling to England for a Seminar.” You will instantly find this is a scam involving a hijacked email account.
I emailed Hotmail at 3:11 AM PDT.
I also responded to “Lynda”.
At 9:13 AM I received an email from the attacker, posing as Lynda thanking me and asking me to send the money through Western Union.
Hotmail has yet to take action.
Yeah, I know not to send the money, but I don’t know about Lynda’s other friends.
The delay by Hotmail may allow this attacker to victimize Lynda’s friends.
I would contact Lynda myself, but I only have her hotmail address.
