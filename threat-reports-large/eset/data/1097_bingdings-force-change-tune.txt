For every retweet, @bing will give $1 to Japan quake victims, up to $100K.

It seems I wasn't the only one to get that piecemeal queasy feeling at the use of what is essentially a chain-letter PR approach to a charitable impulse ("“Look.
We’re being charitable.
But only if you tell lots of people about it!”).
A subsequent tweet from @bing sounds a little more ethically grounded:
We apologize the tweet was negatively perceived.
Intent was to provide an easy way for people to help Japan.
We have donated $100K.
Well, the no-strings donation is a noble gesture, and the page Microsoft was pointing to is actually a useful resource, so I'll refrain from any further BingDings.
