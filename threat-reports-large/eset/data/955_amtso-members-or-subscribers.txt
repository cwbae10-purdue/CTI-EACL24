I've just returned from the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO) workshop in Munich last week.
Lots of useful work was done, but one of the most interesting results is the approval by the members present of a planned low-fee subscription model which will enable individuals and small organizations to participate in workshops and in discussion around (among other things) the creation of documents, but without the voting rights that full membership brings.
