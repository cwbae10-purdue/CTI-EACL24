Well, isn’t today a happy day!
We have International Children’s Day and National Internet Safety Month.
For those of you outside of the US, feel free to join us in the celebration.
In observance of Internet Safety Month, ESET has teamed up with the San Diego Police department to launch SafetyNet eLearning, a free online Internet safety guide for parents, educators and concerned adults.
Created by ESET North America as part of its Securing Our eCity initiative, the SafetyNet eLearning guide allows busy adults to learn – at their own pace and on their own schedule – what needs to be done to keep kids safe online.
If you happen to be In San Diego, tonight, June 1st from 6:00 to 7:45 PM the San Diego Police Foundation and the San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, in conjunction with ESET North America and the AT&T Foundation will be hosting a free Internet safety seminar at the La Jolla Muirlands Middle School auditorium.
To see the SafetyNet eLearning program you can visit http://www.smartcyberchoices.org/elearning/.
Those interested in participating in tonight’s free Internet safety event, contact Darlene Kanzler with the San Diego Police Foundation at darlene at sdpolicefoundation.org or (858) 453-5066 for additional information.
Individuals who complete the SafetyNet eLearning guide will have an opportunity to win an iTunes gift card.
