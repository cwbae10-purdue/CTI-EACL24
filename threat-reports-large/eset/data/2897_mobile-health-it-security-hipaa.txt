Wearable technology and other health-related devices were big at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this month.
This recorded webinar explains why these and related technologies present big challenges for data privacy and security.
Wearable technology and other health-related devices were big at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this month.
The potential benefits of mobile medical technology and telemedicine are enormous, from better quality of life to saving lives, not to mention controlling healthcare costs.
Yet keeping data safe when it is beyond the confines of hospitals and clinics is a serious challenge, one that cannot be met merely through regulatory compliance.
In America, one regulation dominates healthcare information security: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
This was later expanded and updated by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2003 (the HITECH Act).
However, being HIPAA and HITECH compliant is not the same as being secure, I have recorded a webinar to explain why.
I also lay out the reasons for thinking that the protection of mHealth data, that is health data handled by mobile devices, is a such a big security challenge.
I hope you find this webinar helpful.
