The truth is that no anti-phishing technology is reliable.
The technologies can help, sometimes significantly, but the most effective protection is an educated user.
All of the technologies have failure rates and if you think your browser will protect you then you have a seriously bad case of false sense of security syndrome.
One of the best protections is to not follow links in emails.
If I get a message from MySpace saying that someone wants to be my friend, I do not use the link in the emailâ€¦ even if I believe it is a legitimate MySpace email.
If Hotmail Technical Support were to send me an email telling me there is some sort of problem or action that needs to be taken, I will not follow any links in that email.
I will log on to my Hotmail account, which is now Live.com, and access help and support from there to find out if there is a really a problem.
