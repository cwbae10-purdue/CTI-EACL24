Today kicks off the RSA conference in San Francisco.
This is the 20 anniversary for the RSA conference.
RSA stands for Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, who invented RSA encryption.
The RSA conference and trade show has grown from an encryption focused conference to one which includes virtually every aspect of digital security.
As has been the case for at least the past 5 years, ESET has a booth at the trade show again this year.
If you are attending RSA we would love to see you at our booth.
We have presentations to talk about our products, and a presentation discussing some of the biggest security blunders of the past 25 or so years and what lessons we are learning and missing.
Each day ESET will hold a drawing for an iPad and at each presentation there are other drawings.
