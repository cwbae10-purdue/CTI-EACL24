OK, I realize that it looks a little self-obsessed to keep writing about comment spam relating to your own blog.
Actually, while I did write about it recently, on that occasion it was for SC Magazine's Cybercrime Corner.
And that was largely because I'm still chuckling at the concept of a comment spammer complaining about the quantity of unmoderated comment spam a blog attracts.
Not this blog, of course: while we attract depressingly high volumes of comment spam, we moderate, of course.
At least, I was until I checked a comment by someone claiming an email address in the name Trojanowski.
As it turns out, that's a fairly common Polish habitational name, suggesting a family connection with a placename like Trojanów or Trojanowice.
Still, I look forward to a spate of comments from accounts with appropriate Eastern European connections, such as Mr Virusovski or Ms Wormova.
And in case you were wondering (I'm sure you weren't), Harley is also a placename, this time in the UK.
Though on a recent visit to the US I was slightly put out when two people told me their dogs were called Harley…
That's enough whimsy for this week.
