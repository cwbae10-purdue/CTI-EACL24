Adobe, when I disable JavaScript, STOP SILENTLY RE-ENABLING IT WHEN YOU UPDATEâ€¦.
Marketing hate it when I refer to competitor blogs, but Sophos' Vanja Svajcer, while discussing Adobe's accelerated security update (good move, guys!
), makes a point that's worth three hearty cheers and a quote.
If nothing else, JavaScript should be disabled by default in Adobe Reader.
Go on Adobe, make my day.
Yesssssss!!!
!
Though I'd settle for a slightly shorter step towards sanity.
