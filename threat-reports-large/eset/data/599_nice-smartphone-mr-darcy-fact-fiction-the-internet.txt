OK, I'll save the novel for another time.
However, there's a rather less ambitious snippet of my recent writing at http://www.eurograduate.com/article.asp?id=3015&pid=1, an article called "Fact, Fiction and the Internet," and, further to some of my recent posts here, touches on the dangers of social networking.

The article is part of the run-up to Infosecurity Europe (27th-29th of April) where I'm talking about Mac security.
