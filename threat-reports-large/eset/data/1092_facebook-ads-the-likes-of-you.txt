I'm not a great fan of the FB principle of all your datum are belong to us, but I suppose it isn't unreasonable to make use of your Likes as long as you agree to it.

Go to Account (top right corner).
Go to Account Settings.
Click on the Facebook Adverts tab.
Close the "Understanding Social Ads" message box.

If you don't want to play, set to "No one" (the only alternative) and click Save Changes.

If you find out otherwise, by all means let us know in a comment here.
