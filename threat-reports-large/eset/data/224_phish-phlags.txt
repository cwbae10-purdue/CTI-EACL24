Here’s a phish one of ESET’s partners drew our attention to: it’s aimed at users of Maybank (http://www.maybank2u.com), the largest financial services group in Malaysia.
The scam is somewhat more elaborate than many we see, and it’s worth a little analysis to see what flags we can extract from it for spotting a phisher at work From: Maybank

From: Maybank Online Account [mailto:admin@maybank2u.my] [That looks like a genuine address, but it’s spoofed: you’d need access to the mail headers to confirm that, though.]

Lack of personalization is a pretty reliable indicator of spammed, fraudulent mail.]
Dear maybank2u Account Holder, [See above: but even if it used your email address, that wouldn’t be much better.
It’s pretty easy to script a spam mailout to insert each recipient’s email address.
It’s even feasible to parse the address to extract what may be the name of the account holder: however, that can result in curious effects like “Dear jero664…”]
