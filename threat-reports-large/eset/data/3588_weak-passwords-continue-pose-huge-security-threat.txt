People’s choice of passwords continues to be a huge security risk, according to new research.
SplashData’s annual Worst Passwords List finds ‘123456’ and ‘password’ continue to be the most common choice.
People’s choice of passwords continues to pose a huge security risk, according to new research.
The data comes as part of an annual Worst Passwords List.
Compiled by SplashData, it is designed to encourage users to adopt stronger passwords.
It revealed that the two most commonly used are ‘123456’ and ‘password’, both of which have remained at the top of the list since it first started back in 2011.
This highlights the fact that people are still not being vigilant when it comes to online security.
There were signs this year that people are trying to be more creative with their passwords – there were longer alternatives on this year’s list, for example.
However, unfortunately, these are not as secure as people like to think, as users are simply adding meaningless additions to the end of the original password.
For example, instead of ‘123456’, many chose ‘1234567890’.
This is a basic extension, which cybercriminals can take full advantage of.
Morgan Slain, CEO of SplashData, said: “We have seen an effort by many people to be more secure by adding characters to passwords, but if these longer passwords are based on simple patterns they will put you in just as much risk of having your identity stolen by hackers.”
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Star Wars themed passwords have cropped up on the list this year, with ‘starwars’, ‘solo’ and ‘princess’ featuring for the very first time.
Despite their more unique nature, these kinds of passwords are found to be just as insecure, SplashData explained.
