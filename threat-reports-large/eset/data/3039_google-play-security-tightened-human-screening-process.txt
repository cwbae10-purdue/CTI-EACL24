Google is taking additional security measures to shut out malware from its app store by introducing a human screening process.
Google is taking additional security measures to shut out malware from its app store by introducing a human screening process, reports The Register.
It has been revealed that Google Play has been quietly operating a more rigorous review process for the past two months, scanning all submitted applications for code that breaks its developer policies.
The news comes from Eunice Kim, product manager for Google Play, who detailed the changes on the Android Developers Blog.
All Android apps must now go past a team of experts tasked with identifying malware, while developers must also complete questionnaires that will help independent organizations determine age-based ratings.
Although these changes appear to signal a move away from Android’s almost immediate app publishing process, the company stresses that this isn’t the case.
“We value the rapid innovation and iteration that is unique to Google Play, and will continue to help developers get their products to market within a matter of hours after submission, rather than days or weeks.
In fact, there has been no noticeable change for developers during the rollout.”
Google Play security has often been called into question, most recently when a nine-year-old cybersecurity expert demonstrated how downloading a ‘bad’ app can allow hackers to steal your sensitive data in just 15 minutes.
This new screening process, then, will come as welcome news to Android-owners.
