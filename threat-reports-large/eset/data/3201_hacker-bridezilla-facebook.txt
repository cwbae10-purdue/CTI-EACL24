Is a hacker really to blame for unflattering comments posted on a wedding photographer’s Facebook page?
It’s supposed to be the greatest day of every woman’s life.
Your hair is perfect, your make-up immaculate, your dress is drop-dead-gorgeous, the venue is beautiful…
And the photographer?
Of course, you’ve hired a top photographer for your wedding.
And he’ll immortalise your day in celluloid, making you look eternally beautiful.
