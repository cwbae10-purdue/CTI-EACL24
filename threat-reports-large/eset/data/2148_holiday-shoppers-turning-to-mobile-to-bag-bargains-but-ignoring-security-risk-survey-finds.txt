This holiday season, shoppers are turning to mobile as a new way to hunt bargains, with sales via mobile devices nearly doubling – but nearly one third of shoppers polled commited basic security errors of storing identity and credit card data on their devices, and did not use security measures to protect it.
Nearly 40% believed that the convenience of shopping via mobile outweighed the risk.
Half of those used no security protection whatsoever – despite the average spend this year via mobile totalling £260, across those polled.
