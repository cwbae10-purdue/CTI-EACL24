Hackers broke into the MailChimp accounts of some businesses, and send out malicious invoice emails to subscribers… but that doesn’t mean that MailChimp suffered a serious security breach.
Once again, two-factor authentication could have saved users’ bacon.
Let me start with some full disclosure: I pay MailChimp a decent wedge of cash each month to send out newsletters to readers of my personal blog, and I’m quite a fan.
Sending email to a large number of people reliably can be fraught with problems, and I would rather spend my time creating useful or interesting articles than trying to work out why my mail server is suddenly being blacklisted, or becoming entangled in the crazy cobweb of differences in how email clients handle even the simplest HTML.
And, perhaps, most importantly of all – I want to be sure that I don’t endanger the privacy of those people who have signed up for my mailing list by having their details spill into the hands of spammers.
MailChimp is one the world’s leading firms when it comes to email marketing and newsletter delivery.
They do a good job, and their sponsorship of popular podcasts, and use of Freddie the chimpanzee mascot (his full name is apparently Frederick Von Chimpenheimer IV) has helped them to grow an impressive brand.
But you can probably imagine that alarm bells rang when I read a story on Motherboard saying that hackers had broken into business’s MailChimp accounts, and sent out emails to subscribers containing malicious links.
