Pierre’s recent blog on fake invoices mentioned the problems we’re seeing nowadays with Trojans masquerading as anti-virus or anti-spyware programs, and this reminded me that I blogged [link removed as no longer available – DH, 2017] on that topic recently at Quanta Security, one of the external sites for whom I have sometimes done pro bono consultancy or guest writing.
(If you don’t get enough of my ramblings here, my other “outreach” blogs include have included Securiteam and (ISC)2 [I no longer blog at either of these – DH, 2017], not to mention my own blogs, which I’m afraid I haven’t had time to revisit for many moons.
[I didn’t blog at ITsecurity, but, as at Quanta, I contributed answers to a security clinic.
I no longer have any association with either of those sites – DH 2017])
I won’t rewrite that one here and now, since you can just follow the link above, but I’m sure we’ll be back to that topic in the near future: fake programs like XP Antivirus 2008 generate large (and fraudulent) profits.
I also hear there’s a fairly comprehensive article in the Register.
El Reg isn’t always the best source of security information (and some of its writers are sometimes a little anti-AV), but this one is both interesting and generally accurate, though I do have a minor issue with it:
My guess is that people will see the fact that some companies were named as detecting a particular malicious binary as an endorsement of those products, though I very much doubt if that was what the writer intended.
The sad fact is that every time you send a file to VirusTotal, you’re likely to get a different set of vendor IDs or non-identifications each time.
In fact, you may even find that a vendor identifies a single file as one thing the first time you send it, and a slightly different thing if you send it again later.
