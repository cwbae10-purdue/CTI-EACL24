The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has launched an International Strategy, which provides guidance on key issues such as GDPR and changing technologies.
The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has published an International Strategy, which advises on how to manage key global data protection issues.
This is the first time the ICO has launched such a strategy, which aims to increase privacy protection for the UK, tackle challenges posed by the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and deal with changing technologies.
Elizabeth Denham, Information Commissioner at the ICO, said: “There is little doubt that there are challenging times ahead but we are well placed to tackle them.
“This blueprint for how we’ll deliver on our international objectives was informed by experts from all over the world who challenged our perceived priorities and advised on what our next steps should be.”
The four key pillars of the strategy focus on:
Identifying the key priorities the UK should have for GDPR, particularly within the context of leaving the EU
Ensuring the ICO’s authority and relevance remains strong in the face of changing and growing technologies
Ensuring that UK data protection law remains at high global standards
Providing clarity on the legal protections for international data exchange with the EU
The strategy also features an extract from the 2017 Queen’s Speech, announcing the introduction of a Data Protection Bill, which makes a commitment to: “implement the General Data Protection Regulation and the new directive […] meeting our obligations while we remain an EU member state and helping to put the UK in the best position to maintain our ability to share data with other EU member states and internationally after we leave the EU.”
