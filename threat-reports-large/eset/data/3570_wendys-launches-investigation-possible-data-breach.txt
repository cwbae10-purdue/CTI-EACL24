Unusual activity has been reported.
The fast food chain Wendy’s may have been the victim of a data breach, the security expert Brian Krebs has revealed.
Speaking exclusively to Mr. Krebs, Bob Bertini, a spokesperson for Wendy’s, admitted that the company had received notification that it might have been compromised earlier this month.
Wendy’s has since launched an investigation to gain insight into this possible incident.
“We have received this month from our payment industry contacts reports of unusual activity involving payment cards at some of our restaurant locations,” Mr. Bertini said.
“Reports indicate that fraudulent charges may have occurred elsewhere after the cards were legitimately used at some of our restaurants.”
Wendy’s has since officially commented on the matter, stating that it is looking into “unusual activity” on payment cards that have been used at some of its restaurants in the US.
It said: “Until this investigation is completed, it is difficult to determine with certainty the nature or scope of any potential incident.”
There are similarities with this case with a reported data breach at Chick-fil-A last year.
Again, the story was broke by Mr. Krebs.
As with Wendy’s, the eatery was informed by payment industry contacts that there had been “potential unusual activity”.
