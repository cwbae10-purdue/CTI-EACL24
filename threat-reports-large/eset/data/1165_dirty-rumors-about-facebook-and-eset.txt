Perhaps you just read David Harley’s blog http://blog.eset.com/2011/05/20/facebook-gets-something-right.
Now I am about to tell you about something else Facebook got right.
With two accolades in one day dirty, unfounded rumors might start flying about Facebook buying ESET or infiltrating our blog with spies.
To cast off such groundless speculation I’ll tell you about the part that still needs improving too!
If you recall, I took Facebook to task for the manner in which setting the preferences for advertisements was so poorly done.
Facebook has seriously improved the intuitiveness of the display of the information for Facebook Ads settings.
If you go to your Facebook account and click on account settings in the account menu, and then the Facebook Ads tab near the top, now you will see a much more intuitive screen that does not hide a setting as was previously the case.
It is now far more clear what they are talking about.
There is still some mis-information though.
It says “Facebook does not give third party applications or ad networks the right to use your name or picture in ads.
If we allow this in the future, the setting you choose will determine how your information is used.” The truth is that if you do not actively choose your settings then information sharing is based upon what Facebook chose for you.
Effectively this means that Facebook still retains their right to in the future use your kid’s picture to promote alcohol, tobacco, and condoms if you have your kid’s picture in your profile picture.
