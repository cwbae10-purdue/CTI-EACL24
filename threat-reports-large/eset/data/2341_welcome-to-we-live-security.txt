Welcome to the new ESET blog: We Live Security.
In fact, We Live Security is a lot more than a blog: it contains the same great content you have enjoyed on blog.eset.com, but also includes new features and a wider range of content.
For example, here’s a podcast talking about the new site, one of many podcasts now made more accessible.
At ESET we strive to help people from all walks of life to enjoy the benefits of information technology without fear of falling prey to criminals and less scrupulous IT users.
We see We Live Security as one more way to help everyone who uses a digital device or computer system to meet the challenges of security and privacy in the information age.
We Live Security is about research and information, not products.
This is where you’ll find the latest in-depth research, objective threat analysis, and expert advice from all your favorite, multi-award-winning ESET writers.
All of the blog posts they created for blog.eset.com are here, along with new strands of content.
And it’s because our team really does live security that the name We Live Security was chosen.
Security is a 24-hour, 7 days a week, 365 days a year proposition.
We Live Security is always on and always alert to the latest threats.
ESET’s other web properties include Virus Radar, a real-time threat monitoring site; Knowledgebase, the ESET product support site; and ESET.com, the online home of our range of security and antivirus products.
We hope you enjoy the new site and we want to hear from you.
The site will be a better place for your opinion and comment and we’ll be listening to your comments to make sure we give you precisely what you want.
