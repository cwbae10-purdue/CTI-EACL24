Decision makers at banks are in the dark when it comes to data breaches at their organization, according to KPMG’s 2016 Banking Outlook Survey.
It revealed that this is especially the case when it comes to the second tier of senior management.
For example, while 12% of CEOs were unaware as to whether their networks had been compromised in the past two years, the number was markedly higher among their immediate colleagues.
The survey found that 47% of banking executive vice presidents and managing directors could not confidently state whether their respective institutions had experienced a data breach.
Among senior vice presidents and directors, the number was higher.
Approximately 72% admitted to not knowing whether such an incident had occurred.
“Banks are under an onslaught of attacks from bad actors, so the fact that 12% of banking CEOs reported that they don’t know if they’ve been compromised is troublesome,” commented Charlie Jacco, financial services cyber leader at KPMG.
“Cyber is a business bottom-line issue: a true CEO issue.”
The survey highlighted the top concerns that CEOs have with data breaches.
Possible financial loss is the biggest cause of unease, followed by reputational damage and litigation.
