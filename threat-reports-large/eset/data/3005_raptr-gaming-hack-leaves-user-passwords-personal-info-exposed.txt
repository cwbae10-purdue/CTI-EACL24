Gamers using Raptr and AMD Gaming Evolved chat services should change their login details immediately, following a breach that could give hackers access to names, email addresses and passwords
Gamers using Raptr and AMD Gaming Evolved chat services should change their login details immediately, following a breach that could give hackers access to names, email addresses and passwords, reports PC World.
Raptr founder and CEO Dennis Fong warned of the hack in a blog post last week, saying that although the passwords are hashed, users with weak passwords could be left vulnerable.
“User names, email addresses, password hashes, and some first and last names may have been accessed,” Fong explained.
“Although the potential risk to Raptr users is pretty minimal,” says Fong, “we urge you to access any accounts on other sites and services in which you use the same login and password associated with your Raptr account and change the related password(s) immediately.”
“We’re extremely sorry about this situation and are committed to further improving account security going forward,” Fong added.
Raptr was launched back in 2007 as a service to connect popular chat services used while gaming – including Facebook chat, Steam and Yahoo!
Instant Messenger – while offering players the opportunity to optimize their favorite titles and watch clips from other gamers.
The Raptr service also powers the AMD app, which is a similar client for AMD gamers.
Fong did not reveal how many users are affected by the data leak, but Raptr’s AMD app is installed by default with the company’s graphics drivers, unless users opt out, according to PC World.
