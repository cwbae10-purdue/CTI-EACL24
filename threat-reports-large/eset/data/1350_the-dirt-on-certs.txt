Róbert Lipovský and I put our heads together and posted a joint article to SC Magazine’s Cybercrime Corner on “Dead Certs?”
We've had a lot of enquiries recently about DigiNotar, Globalsign, and the death of the Certificate Authority.
(Not to mention the death of the firewall and the death of AV, but I don't think I can bear another of those right now… ) Having responded to several of those between us, Róbert Lipovský (malware researcher at ESET's HQ in Bratislava and a frequent contributor to this blog) and I put our heads together and posted a joint article to SC Magazine's Cybercrime Corner on "Dead Certs?"
in a sort of FAQ format.
SC Mag also published a short article of mine on the aftermath of the 9/11 anniversary.
Of course, there have been many articles around that topic: Bruce Schneier included a comprehensive list of 10-year anniversary articles in his latest "Cryptogram" newsletter.
He also included sections on Terrorism in the U.S.
