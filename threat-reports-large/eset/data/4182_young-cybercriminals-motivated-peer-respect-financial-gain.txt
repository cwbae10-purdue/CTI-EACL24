A new report suggests young cybercriminals are often motivated by the possibility of notoriety, rather than financial gain.
An increasing number of young cybercriminals are motivated more by a sense of notoriety and popularity with their peers rather than by financial gain.
That is the main finding from a new report published by the UK government’s National Crime Agency (NCA), which found that many young offenders are turning to cybercrime as a way of chasing a feeling of accomplishment or to increase their online reputation with their peers.
In a case outlined by the report, one youngster told officers: “… it made me popular, I enjoyed the feeling … I looked up to those users with the best reputations”.
The paper warns that the average age of those involved in cybercrime (17) is significantly lower when compared to that of other offences, such as drugs (37).
The report claims that a number of offenders find a route into cybercrime by participating in gaming cheat websites, which in turn allow them to ‘mod’ – modify – their games.
This can then progress into more serious criminal behavior, with the NCA warning that off-the-shelf tools such as DDOS-for-hire services and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are relatively accessible, with some even coming with step-by-step tutorials.
The report has subsequently stated that more needs to be done in order to ensure that young people understand the gravity of such offences, while also adding that more talented youngsters should have the opportunity to use their education and skills to pursue a career in cybersecurity.
