Somewhere in a small city in south central Russia, a group of men in their twenties have got away with what some are describing as one of the biggest cyber-heists in history.
Somewhere in a small city in south central Russia, a group of men in their twenties have got away with what some are describing as one of the biggest cyber-heists in history.
The gang, which has been dubbed “CyberVor” (“vor” means “thief” in Russian) by security researchers, is thought to be in possession of the largest known haul of stolen internet credentials – 1.2 billion usernames and passwords, together with 542 million email addresses.
And the data has been stolen from some 420,000 different websites.
That’s the astonishing claim being made this week by Milwaukee firm Hold Security, who have used the backdrop of the Black Hat and Def Con conferences taking place in Las Vegas this week to announce their discovery, with a little help from reporters at the New York Times.
And naturally the company isn’t being entirely altruistic with its announcement – it’s also using the opportunity to promote its penetration testing and identity monitoring services.
I must admit, how they have gone about things has left a bad taste in my mouth.
Frustratingly, Hold Security isn’t saying what sites have been hacked, or given users any method to determine if their account credentials might have been included in the haul.
So quite how the average computer user is supposed to respond to an announcement with such a lack of actionable detail is anybody’s guess.
All the researchers said is that the gang amassed its treasure trove by using botnets to identify websites with SQL injection vulnerabilities, and scooping up their data.
