The first few days of 2018 have been filled with anxious discussions concerning a widespread and wide-ranging vulnerability in the architecture of processors based on Intel’s Core architecture used in PCs for many years, and also affecting ARM processors commonly used in tablets and smartphones.
Update (12 Nov – 21:35 CET): On October 17th, a Microsoft engineer confirmed via Twitter that starting with 19H1, the Windows operating system’s kernel would be compiled using Google’s retpoline mitigations to improve performance of Spectre V2 mitigations in the kernel.
Update (23 May – 8:40 CET): On May 18th, researchers from Eclypsium announced their research into System Management Mode Speculative Execution Attacks, which allow an attacker to access the contents of System Management Mode (SMM) memory, a highly-privileged section of memory to which the operating system typically does not have access.

More information, including download instructions, can be found on Microsoft’s web site at KB4078130: Update to disable mitigation against Spectre, Variant 2.
ESET’s software is not affected by this update, and recommends customers follow guidance from Microsoft and other operating system vendors in applying patches for the Meltdown and Spectre CPU vulnerabilities.
UPDATE (24 January – 08:02 CET): On Monday, January 22, Intel issued a statement confirming it had identified the root cause of reboot issues affecting its microcode updates to patch the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.
Intel is asking customers to suspend applying them until new fixes are available which resolve the reboot issues.
ESET’s software is not impacted by these microcode updates, and ESET recommends using the latest version of its consumer or enterprise software regardless of the state of CPU or operating system patches for Meltdown and Spectre.
We also recommend checking with Intel for updated information on new patches, as well as other applicable vendors.
NOTE: Microsoft released Security Advisory 18002 on Wednesday, January 3, 2018 announcing mitigation for a major vulnerability to Windows in modern CPU architectures.
ESET released Antivirus and Antispyware module 1533.3 with update 16680 the same day to all customers to ensure that use of our products would not affect compatibility with Microsoft’s patch.
The first few days of 2018 have been filled with anxious discussions concerning a widespread and wide-ranging vulnerability in the architecture of processors based on Intel’s Core architecture used in PCs for many years, as well as processors from AMD.
The scope of the vulnerability is wide-ranging, affecting everything from the ARM processors commonly used in tablets and smartphones to the IBM POWER processors used in supercomputers.
For information about the effects of these vulnerabilities on the Internet of Things, please see Righard Zwienenberg’s article, “MADIoT – The nightmare after XMAS (and Meltdown, and Spectre).”
When this article was initially written, not all details have been released, but reportedly the issue was that programs running in user-mode address space (the “normal” range of memory in which application software, games and the like run) on a computer can infer or “see ” some of the information stored in kernel-mode address space (the “protected” range of memory used to contain the operating system, its device drivers, and sensitive information such as passwords and cryptography certificates).
Fixes to prevent user-mode programs from “peering inside” kernel-mode memory are being introduced by operating system vendors, hypervisor vendors and even cloud computing companies, but it appears the initial round of patches will slow down operating systems to some extent.
The exact amount of slowdown is open to debate.
Intel has stated the performance penalty will “not be significant” for most users, but Linux enthusiast site Phoronix has benchmarked performance penalties from 5-30%, depending upon what the computer is doing.
A long Reddit thread titled Intel bug incoming has been tracking the vulnerability since information about it began to appear on January 2, 2018; Ars Technica and The Register have had excellent coverage, as well.
Processor manufacturer AMD announced that they are unaffected, according to reports on CNBC and a message to the Linux Kernel Mailing List by an AMD engineer, but reports from both Google‘s Project Zero and Microsoft state that AMD processors are affected.
Since then, AMD has released a statement for clarification.
Both AMD and Nvidia announced that their GPUs are not vulnerable, although the latter has issued software updates to its device drivers for operating systems affected by the vulnerabilities.
Qualcomm has confirmed to journalists that its CPUs are affected, but has issued no security advisories or bulletins at the time of this writing.
The Microsoft article goes on to note that this is not a Windows-specific issue, and that it affects Android, Chrome OS, iOS and macOS as well.
Red Hat‘s advisory includes IBM’s POWER architecture as being vulnerable, which IBM subsequently confirmed.
Hypervisor manufacturers VMware and Xen have issued their own advisories, as has Amazon Web Services.
Patching operating systems and processor microcode is a complex process, and not all of the updates have gone smoothly: On January 9, Microsoft suspended the Windows update for some older AMD CPUs due to compatibility issues.
On January 13, Dell, Lenovo and VMware suspended their microcode updates for some Broadwell, Haswell, Kaby Lake and Xeon CPUs due to reports of issues after installation.
Here is a list of affected vendors and their respective advisories and/or patch announcements:
Kevin Beaumont of DoublePulsar Security, announced on Twitter that he is tracking the compatibility of anti-malware software with Microsoft’s patches in a Google Docs spreadsheet.
The confusion over brands of affected CPUs may be due to the fact that this is not one vulnerability, but two similar vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre by their respective discoverers.
The Meltdown vulnerability is limited to Intel’s processors, while Spectre affects AMD, ARM, IBM, Intel and possibly other processors as well.
These vulnerabilities have three CVE numbers (a quasi-government standard for tracking computer security vulnerabilities and exposures) assigned to them:
For many years, processor manufacturers – such as Intel – have been able to fix flaws in processor architecture through microcode updates, which write an update to the processor itself to fix a bug.
When this article was originally published, ESET wrote that the vulnerabilities might not be fixable with a microcode update to Intel processors, however, it now appears that it may be possible to mitigate the Spectre vulnerability in Intel CPUs via microcode update, as well as provide additional protection against the Meltdown vulnerability.
Intel’s security advisory, INTEL-SA-00088 Speculative Execution and Indirect Branch Prediction Side Channel Analysis Method, lists forty-four (44) affected families of processors, each of which can contain dozens of models.
ARM Limited has released an advisory titled Vulnerability of Speculative Processors to Cache Timing Side-Channel Mechanism that currently lists ten (10) affected models of processor.
Computer emergency, incident , and security response teams from around the world have issued advisories to their respective countries.
As mentioned at the beginning of the article, ESET released Antivirus and Antispyware module update 1533.3 on Wednesday, January 3, 2018, to all customers to ensure compatibility with Microsoft’s updates to the Windows operating systems.
ESET is working alongside hardware and software vendors to mitigate the risk posed by the vulnerabilities.
