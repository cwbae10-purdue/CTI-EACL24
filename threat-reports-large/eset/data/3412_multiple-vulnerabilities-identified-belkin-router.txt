An expert says that a popular Belkin router contains numerous vulnerabilities, making it extremely susceptible to attacks.
There are multiple vulnerabilities in a Belkin router that could leave it open to an attack, according to the CERT/CC Division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in the US.
Joel Land, a vulnerability analyst at CERT, reported that Belkin’s N600 DB Wireless Dual Band N+ router – model F9K1102 v2 – contains five specific flaws that make it extremely exploitable.
He said: “A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to spoof DNS responses to cause vulnerable devices to contact attacker-controlled hosts or induce an authenticated user into making an unintentional request to the web server that will be treated as an authentic request.”
Additionally, the expert continued, a local area network (LAN) based attacker would be able to completely circumvent the need for authentication and “take complete control of vulnerable devices”.
Problematically, Mr Land highlighted, there isn’t a “practical solution” to these identified vulnerabilities at present.
However, there are some temporary solutions for anyone that relies on this specific model.
Namely, they should consider “workarounds” suggested by CERT/CC.
These include employing strong passwords for Wi-Fi – as well as the web management interface – and only allowing trusted hosts to be able to connect to the LAN.
