Fatigues – $28 Army boots -$129 GPS – $249 Good directions?
Priceless It seems the Swiss accidentally invaded Liechtenstein (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/02/world/main2530066.shtml).
Now this is funny first and foremost because nobody got hurt.
There were lots of other reasons it was funny too.
For example, a neutral nation invading an unarmed nation is a rather comedic situation.

I got to thinking about how this could happen.
I suppose it is possible that the Swiss soldiers came to the USA and TSA took away their pocket knives with the little compasses on them.
That’s believable.
Then I thought what if they have GPS units, what would cause them to malfunction?
Back at the RSA conference in San Francisco in a keynote speech, John Thompson warned the audience that if we got lost in San Francisco that day it might be that their GPS was infected with a worm or a virus!
I’ll ask our developers to look into NOD32 for GPS’s right away!
