We are slowly seeing the “industrialization” of cybercrime according to an expert.
Dr. Adrian Nish, head of cyber threat intelligence at BAE, said that cybercriminals are becoming more “professionalized”, the Telegraph reported.
He explained: “They are running phone support scams, writing their own software that comes with service agreements and money-back guarantees if the code gets detected with the promise of a replacement.”
The UK broadsheet newspaper also revealed that the defense group is facing relentless rounds of cyberattacks.
The company said that this happens at least twice a week, with cybercriminals attempting to steal sensitive defense secrets.
BAE Systems, which is the world’s third largest arms group in the world, claimed that foreign government-backed attackers are behind the attacks.
It added that those responsible for the breaches are what it describes as “unusual suspects”.
These actors have been put into six categories – mules, professionals, nation state actors, activists, getaways and insiders.
Getaways, for example, are described as individuals “too young to be prosecuted”, while mules are those “naïve opportunists who may not even realize they work for criminal gangs to launder money”.
