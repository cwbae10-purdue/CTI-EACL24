Alas, Andrew Lee, our beloved leader in the Research team, has left ESET for green fields and postures – er, pastures – new.
He was last observed heading for the beach and muttering something about bikinis, but assures us that he isn’t leaving the antivirus industry.
That’s certainly a good thing, as even before he joined
Alas, Andrew Lee, our beloved leader in the Research team, has left ESET for green fields and postures – er, pastures – new.
He was last observed heading for the beach and muttering something about bikinis, but assures us that he isn’t leaving the antivirus industry.
That’s certainly a good thing, as even before he joined ESET, he was well respected in the industry, and his influence since joining has extended far beyond the borders of ESET.
In the Research team, we’ll miss his support and his vision, not to mention his wit.
Especially those of us who have inherited his enormous workload.
;-)
All the best, AJ.
