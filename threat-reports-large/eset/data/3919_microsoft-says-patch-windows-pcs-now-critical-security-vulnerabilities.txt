Don’t rest on your laurels.
Patch your vulnerable computer systems now.
Every month has a second Tuesday, and that means every month has a Patch Tuesday – the day when Microsoft issues its regular as clockwork bundle of security updates, fixing vulnerabilities in its software that could be exploited by malicious hackers.
Yesterday was no exception, as Microsoft issued nine security bulletins – five of which were given the highest severity rating of “critical”.
Most of the critical vulnerabilities are to be found in Microsoft’s web browsers – Internet Explorer and Edge – opening the door for attacks to be instigated simply by visiting a poisoned webpage.
But it’s not just buggy browsers.
