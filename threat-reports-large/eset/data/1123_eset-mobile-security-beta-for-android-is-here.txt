As I have blogged about the Android platform a recurring comment has been “When will ESET have protection for my Android?” Well, I still don’t know when it will be available for sale, but for those who understand the risks involved with running beta software, have backed up all of their data on their Adnroid devices and want to give it a spin, you can download the beta at http://www.eset.com/us/beta/mobile-security-for-android.
Also at that site is a link to provide feedback and bug reports!
By the way, for those of you like me who have a CDMA device (Verizon, Sprint, etc.)
