The sad truth is that scammers and fraudsters don’t have any conscience, and are prepared to do anything if it might net them a rich reward.
So it’s no surprise to see them taking advantage of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine.
When Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Ukrainian airspace in July of this year, the world was understandably shocked.
The news of an civilian passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur being possibly downed by a surface-to-air missile was horrifying enough, but coming just months after the loss of another Malaysian Airlines flight (MH370) in mysterious circumstances made the headlines seemed even harder to believe.
As we have previously documented on We Live Security, the earlier lost aircraft has been the subject of various scams including a fraudulent message that spread on Facebook claiming it had been found, a fake video of the supposed rescue of its passengers, as well as claims that hackers had stolen secret classified documents held by Malaysian government officials.
