The slides for many of the presentations by ESET researchers at VB 2012 can now be found on the Virus Bulletin conference web pages.
As you’ll know if you’ve read this month’s ESET Global Threat Report, ESET had quite a few papers and presentations accepted at this year’s Virus Bulletin conference.
Many of those (along with many excellent presentations by other security researchers) can now be found on the Virus Bulletin conference slides page here and I’d encourage you to find some time to take a look at them all.
However, here’s a quick guide to the ESET presentations now available there.
