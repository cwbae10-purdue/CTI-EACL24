Still trying to catch up with blogs previously promised.
I did say that I might review Michael Miller’s book “Is it safe?
Protecting your computer, your business, and yourself online”, and indeed I did.
However, the review was published in this month’s Virus Bulletin (March 2009), so I can’t use it here.
Here’s a somewhat briefer summary: it’s reasonably accurate, well-written, but doesn’t include much in the way of deep analysis.
Security specialists (and even most wannabes) won’t find much in it that’s new to them, but general users and generalist management might find it a useful starting point.
However, it doesn’t altogether live up to its sub-title: you’d need to know lots more than this to implement adequate corporate security.
