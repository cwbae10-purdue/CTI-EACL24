Hi James, I am not familiar with a virus named vxauio.exe, but that looks a whole lot like a file name.
File names are almost never reliable

Hi James,
I am not familiar with a virus named vxauio.exe, but that looks a whole lot like a file name.
File names are almost never reliable indicators of what a virus is.
Executable files can be infected with any number of viruses.
I would refer you and other readers to a previous blog entry “So You Have An Undetected Virus?” at http://eset.com/threat-center/blog/?p=36.
The steps for dealing with vxaudio.exe will be the same as described in that blog entry.
Without a sample it is really impossible for me to accurately give you any information about the file or virus in question.
