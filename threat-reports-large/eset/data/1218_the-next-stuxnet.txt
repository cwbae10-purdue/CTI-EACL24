…the ‘next Stuxnet’ probably won’t be any such thing, whatever we may choose to call it…
In fact, the main point of the article I just sent up to SC Magazine's Cybercrime Corner, "Stuxnet: Paradigms Lost and Paradise Regained" is that the 'next Stuxnet' probably won't be any such thing, whatever we may choose to call it.
Stuxnet was certainly a warning, but the message is a bit less dramatic than a revolution in scientific thinking.
