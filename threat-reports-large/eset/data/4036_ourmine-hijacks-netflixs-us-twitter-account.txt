Netflix has become the latest big name brand to have one of its social media accounts hijacked by OurMine.
The hacking collective was briefly able to take over Netflix’s US Twitter account yesterday (December 21st), posting numerous tweets that were indicative of its signature style.
This included: “Hey, it’s OurMine, Don’t worry we are just testing your security, contact us to tell you more about that…”
There was some initial confusion about whether Netflix, which describes itself as the world’s leading internet television network, had regained full control over its account.
However, this has since been resolved.
At the time of writing, no further details have been made as to how OurMine was able to gain access.
OurMine has built of a reputation of compromising high-profile individuals and organizations.
This includes Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, whose Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest accounts were hijacked in June.
It was revealed at the time that his password for all three accounts were the same.
It was “dadada”.
Other victims include Variety, which had its content management system compromised in September.
