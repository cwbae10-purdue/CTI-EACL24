Acer has experienced a major data breach, with up to 34,500 of its customers thought to be affected.
It has already submitted a “breach notification sample” to the Office of the Attorney General in California, which states that one of its ecommerce sites was compromised.
Worryingly, the electronics corporation has admitted that the data breach has affected “certain customers” who used the site between May 12th, 2015, and April 28th, 2016.
Personal information thought to have been compromised includes names, addresses and card numbers – including three-digit security codes.
Acer was keen to highlight in the letter that it doesn’t collect Social Security numbers and that, at the time of writing, it has yet to find any evidence that suggests password or logins details were compromised.
The major data breach is US focused, the company claimed.
Customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are secure, in part, because “its ecommerce stores are hosted separately from other regions”.
“Safeguarding your personal information is important to us,” Acer stated in the sample letter it is sending out to its customers.
“We took immediate steps to remediate this security issue upon identifying it, and we are being assisted by outside cybersecurity experts.
