A new study finds that current university students have a mature approach to social media that helps keep them safe from cybercrime.
Current university students have a strong understanding of how best to use social media, resulting in them being “less vulnerable to cybercrime”.
This is according to a study by Kingston Business School in the UK, which found that in comparison to recent graduates, they tend to be “safer users” of websites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.
As a result of knowing how to use social media in an effective and mature way, current students reported fewer instances of harassment and exposure to offensive content.
Associate professor Vladlena Benson, a specialist in accounting, finance and informatics, and lead author of this paper, attributes some of this to the work done by universities to better safeguard its students.
“It has always been difficult for crime to flourish in communities where people enjoy close connections,” she said.
“We believe the bonds that students make on campus coupled with institution-led initiatives make them far less likely to be victims of online crime than at any other point in their lives.”
The study also observed a notable shift in use of social media, with current students demonstrating an interest in using such services beyond “informal networking with family and friends”.
What professor Benson discovered was that young people are using social media to support and enhance their learning experiences.
