WWE superstar Antonio Cesaro was the victim of a Twitter hack this week, as a wrestling fanatic hacked his account to vent against company chairman and CEO Vince McMahon.
WWE superstar Antonio Cesaro was embarrassed on social media this week, as a wrestling fanatic hacked into his Twitter account to vent against company CEO and chairman Vince McMahon.
As reported by TalkSport, Cesaro appeared to launch a sensational attack on the WWE’s majority shareholder across a string of inflammatory tweets, including one which ‘wished cancer’ on the 69-year-old mogul.
Referring to Mr McMahon, the tweet read, “I hope that old man gets cancer, I would of been one of the best for sure in the WWE.
But that old washed up has been has no idea.”
All of the tweets have now been deleted from the social media network, but were widely shared and retweeted during the hacking.
Although it was initially unclear whether the comments were genuine or not, the hacker later owned up to impersonating the star as he continued to rant through Cesaro’s Twitter account.
According to quoted tweets on Digital Spy, the hacker wrote: “This isn’t an attack at Cesaro by any means.
This is purely me getting my anger out at WWE on Cesaro’s behalf.”
While wrestlers may sometimes play the villain inside the ring, this is not the first time hackers have exploited social media accounts to get sports entertainment stars into real-life trouble.
As Business Insider reports, just last week WWE superstar Seth Rollins was the victim of a hack which resulted in the leaking of nude photos.
As for Cesaro, he eventually regained control of his account, as the hacker signed off: “Okay I’m gonna give this back to Cesaro now.
Thanks for the fun.
