Russian hacker receives the longest sentence ever handed down for hacking-related charges in the United States.
For four years, between October 2009 and October 2013, Roman Valeryevich Seleznev hacked into retail point-of-sale (PoS) systems, installing malware that stole payment card details from purchasers, and selling the data to the criminal underworld.
Many of the 32-year-old Russian’s victims were small businesses – including a number of US restaurants, including one (the Broadway Grill in Seattle) that was forced into bankruptcy through the attack.
In all, more than 500 American businesses and 3,700 financial institutions are said to have fallen victim to malware planted by Seleznev.
At his trial, evidence was presented that Seleznev hacks sent stolen credit card data from infected point-of-sale systems to servers under his control in Russia, Ukraine and Virginia.
In all, Seleznev’s activities are said to have cost 3,700 financial institutions a jaw-dropping $169 million.
All that came to an end in July 2014 when Seleznev was taken into custody in the Maldives, while holidaying with his girlfriend.
When his laptop was later forensically examined it was found to contain more than 1.7 million stolen credit card details, as well as other evidence linking him to the servers and financial transactions linked to the scheme.
It must suck to have your vacation in the Maldives ruined by law enforcement agencies taking you into custody.
It must grate to find that the authorities have a wealth of evidence against you, implicating you in a multi-million criminal scheme.
But you know what must really hurt Seleznev?
