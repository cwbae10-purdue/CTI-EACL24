Cyberbullying and online abuse is a growing problem, and one insurance company is taking it so seriously that’s it’s willing to cover those who fall victim to harassment on the internet.
As reported by the Washington Post, Chubb insurance in the UK has defined cyberbullying as, “three or more acts by the same person or group to harass, threaten or intimidate a customer.” They’ve declared that policy holders who buy its personal insurance will be covered for up to £50,000 which goes towards the likes of counseling, lost income for time off work as well as assistance from online experts for cyberbullying victims.
Tara Parchment, UK and Ireland private clients manager, told the Telegraph, “We see insurance as helping our clients get back to how they were before the incident occurred – whether it’s an incident that affects their home or as a person.
So we still help to restore homes, cars and belongings that have suffered physical harm or damage, but increasingly it’s about the person and how they cope.”
A recent study by mobile network Vodafone found that one in five teenagers find themselves victim to cyberbullying, but the problem is not just limited to younger generations.
A Pew Research report found that 73% of American adults have seen somebody be harassed online, while 40% have experienced it themselves.
