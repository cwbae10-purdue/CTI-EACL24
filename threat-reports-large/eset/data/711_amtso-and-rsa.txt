Greetings, friends and fiends.
I've been uncharacteristically quiet for the past couple of weeks, due to the AMTSO workshop last week in Santa Clara.
There was, as usual, some lively discussion: though no papers were approved at the meeting, some are close enough to finished to be voted on shortly.

(See also the AMTSO blog for more updates, in particular on yesterday's AMTSO panel session.)
At the moment I'm at RSA, as Randy mentioned in a previous blog.
I'm not working the ESET stand, but Randy and Jeff are around there much of the time, if you'd like to say hello, and if anyone wants to talk to me specifically, someone at the stand can put you in touch with me.
