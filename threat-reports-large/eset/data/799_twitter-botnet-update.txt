As more information has come in, the detection name has been changed from MSIL/Agent.NBW to MSIL/Twebot.A, in an attempt to use a name that corresponds to one used by other vendors.
Unfortunately, the industry has not standardized (no change there, then) on a single name (other names being used include Troj/Tbotcfg-A and Trojan.Twitbot.A), but at least this name should (slightly) reduce potential confusion among customers and others.
It also reflects the fact that this threat now looks like a significant malware family in its own right: a major MSIL/Twebot.B variant has already crawled out from under its rock.
