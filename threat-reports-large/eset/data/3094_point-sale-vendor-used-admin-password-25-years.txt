A major vendor of point-of-sale terminals has not changed the default passwords used on its devices in a quarter of a century, researchers have revealed at RSA 2015.
A major vendor of point-of-sale terminals has not changed the default passwords used on its devices in a quarter of a century, researchers have revealed at RSA 2015.
The firm was not named during the presentation by Charles Henderson and David Byrne for security reasons, but it is said to be a widely used manufacturer.
Although the password can (and should) be changed, CIO reports that the researchers believed in most cases they were left as customers assumed the password – 166816 – was unique to them.
In fact this was not the case, and the researchers estimate that the code was used in 90 percent of point-of-sale products from the company dating back to 1990.
Any exploit would require physical access to the equipment: The Register states that an attack would involve “opening a panel using a paperclip,” a maneuver it goes on to describe as “child’s play for malicious staff.”
The 166816 password is sometimes Z66816 – but in those cases it’s because of different keyboard layouts, rather than a nod to good password hygiene.
“I actually saw this password really recently on a different manufacturer’s device [by a customer] who thought the password was unique to them,” Henderson said during the talk.
According to Geek.com, this lax approach to password security isn’t limited to just a single point-of-sale terminal provider either.
