Our friends at Virus Bulletin are hosting a seminar later this month that looks as if it should be worth a visit.
Of course, security seminars are ten a penny, but this one is organized by the security-knowledgeable but vendor-agnostic magazine whose annual conference is one of the major highlights of an anti-malware researcher's year.
(Yes, we are sponsoring it: we sponsor quite a few security events.)
Speakers at the event include:
Bryan Littlefair, Vodafone Group
Bob Burls, Police Central e-Crime Unit
Juraj Malcho, ESET
David Evans, Information Commissioner's Office
Graham Cluley, Sophos
Alex Shipp
Richard Martin, UK Payments Administration
Andrew Lee, K7 Computing
Martin Overton, IBM
The full agenda is at http://www.virusbtn.com/seminar/programme, and if I wasn't supposed to know all this stuff already, I'd probably be registering myself.
