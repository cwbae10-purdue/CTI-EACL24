We’re not in it for prizes (or cakes), but there’s no denying that we’re thrilled to be a finalist for the European Security Blogger Awards – and in five categories at that!
We’re delighted to announce that WeLiveSecurity has been shortlisted as a finalist in the 2018 edition of the European Security Blogger Awards in these categories (yes, including the big one):
Best Corporate Security Blog
Best European Corporate Security Blog
Most Entertaining Blog
Most Educational Blog
Grand Prix Prize for the Best Overall Security Blog
As you might have imagined, writing on cybersecurity is a crowded field and we’re pitted against some tough competitors.
These awards are an excellent opportunity to recognize the cream of the crop, and we’re honored to have made it among the very best.
Our team of security professionals literally lives security in order to help our readers make sense of the ever-evolving security landscape.
This involves leveraging the unique perspectives and expertise of ESET’s researchers working in the trenches.
That way, we’re able to provide you with a unique glimpse into some of the most pressing threats lurking in cyberspace.
All along the way, WeLiveSecurity strikes a fine balance in that it provides insightful content, but never scaremongers.
After all, none of what we do would make sense without you, our readers, and we’re thoroughly aware of it.
