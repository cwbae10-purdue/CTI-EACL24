WPS, Reaver, and what you can expect from anti-virus by way of vulnerability scanning
Just published in SC Magazine's Cybercrime Corner, expanding on a conversation I had recently with Kevin Townsend, is an article on "Great Expectations" that discusses WPS, "Whoops!!
!," the Grim Reaver, and what you can expect from anti-virus.
In terms of vulnerability detection, that is.
I'm tempted to say "what the Dickens!"
