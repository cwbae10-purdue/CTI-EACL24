Security research is published in many forms.
For example, there are live and recorded webinars that cover a range of cybersecurity topics.
The published output of ESET security researchers appears in many forms, from articles here on We Live Security — like this recent analysis of Linux server malware — to white papers and conference papers.
There is even a We Live Security magazine and a year-long series of live and recorded webinars.
It is these webinars that I want to highlight today.
They are available on a service called Brighttalk where ESET has its own channel.
You can sign up to be notified of upcoming webinars and attend them live.
I enjoy the live delivery of webinars on Brighttalk because the system allows me to put questions to the audience, and for the audience to ask questions of me.
However, not everyone can drop what they are doing to participate in a webinar, so the event is recorded and made available online so you can partake at your convenience.
I’d like to encourage you to attend a webinar and see if they work for you (I have one coming up on May 27 in which I will be looking at the role that risk analysis plays in securing your organization against cyber risks).
I would be delighted to get your feedback on the content, and any suggestions you have for future topics.
In the meantime, here is an example of a recorded webinar from earlier this year, one that has been watched by hundreds of people.
The topic is cyber legislation in the United States, something that does not move very quickly, so a lot of the commentary is still relevant.
Feel free to leave a comment if you think I got things wrong or would like more content of this type.
(And just FYI, that is not me in the photo atop this article – my shirts are a lot better ironed than that.).
