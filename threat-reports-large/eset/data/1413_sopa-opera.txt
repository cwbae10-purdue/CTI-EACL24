We all have our concerns about piracy and violations of intellectual property, but the discussion taking place at the moment behind closed doors seems pretty one-sided.
You may have noticed that ESET researchers are not enthusiastic about the present drafts of the SOPA and PIPA acts:
Stephen Cobb: DNSChanger and PROTECT IP: FBI hit and legislative miss
Andrew Lee: SOPA and PIPA and DNS: An open letter to Congress
Your humble scribe: DNSSEC, SOPA, and PIPA
Naturally, we all have our concerns about piracy and violations of intellectual property, but the discussion taking place at the moment behind closed doors seems pretty one-sided: as the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out, the only witness scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee today represents Google, whereas many of the other witnesses actually drafted the SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) under discussion today.
The EFF article includes a good summary of the other parties that should have been representedâ€¦

And for a contrarian view, Andrew Orlowski's article for the Register seems to suggest, surprisingly, that attacking Google's credibility in the anti-piracy arena undermines all opposition to the current draft.
