A paper from researchers at various universities suggests that security is an area that needs work for wearables, according to a report in The Register.
A paper from researchers at various universities suggests that privacy is an area that needs work for wearables, according to a report in The Register.
The paper, entitled ‘Privacy of Big Data in the Internet of Things Era‘ was written by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Australian National University, Sydney University, Dakota State University, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.
It examines the quantities of ‘highly sensitive’ personal information wearables collect in order to function as advertised – data collection that makes the likes of Facebook’s seem minimal by comparison.
“Google Glass, Apple iWatch, Google Fit, Apple Health Kit, and Apple Home Kit may collect very sensitive information about users, ranging from their health conditions to financial status by observing/recording daily activities,” the authors write in the paper.
The paper covers the privacy challenges faced by all stakeholders in wearables, from the manufacturers and app developers to the consumers themselves, and examines the responsibility of each party in ensuring privacy is maintained.
Over its seven pages, it outlines some clear issues with wearables including user consent, free choice and anonymity.
