Pippa Middleton is the latest in a long line of celebrities to have her online accounts broken into by criminals, and private photographs stolen.
Have you properly secured your iCloud account?
This weekend it emerged that Pippa Middleton was the latest in a long line of celebrities to have her online accounts broken into by criminals, and private photographs stolen.
As The Daily Mail reports, a man who had allegedly broken into Pippa Middleton’s iCloud account was offering 3,000 private photographs of the 33-year-old socialite including snaps of her at a wedding dress fitting, and naked photographs of her fiancé James Matthews.
Included in the haul, according to media reports, were private images of Pippa Middleton’s sister, and her sister’s children, George and Charlotte.
Things become more serious when you remember that Pippa Middleton’s sister is Kate Middleton, officially known as the Duchess of Cambridge, and wife of Prince William.
Fortunately even the British tabloid media appears to have baulked at the idea of publishing the stolen photographs, and it was no surprise to hear that police have made an arrest.
What is important to understand is that this, and many of the previous celebrity “hacks” that we have heard about in the past, did not probably occur because of some underlying security vulnerability in Apple’s iCloud system.
Instead, my hunch is that Pippa Middleton’s account was not following best security practices and had not properly secured her account.
My recommendation is that all iCloud users enable two-factor authentication on their accounts to increase the security on their Apple ID.
