An apparent glitch is preventing a number of users from signing in to their accounts
A number of Twitter users from around the globe report experiencing problems when attempting to log in to their accounts.
The microblogging site is investigating what seems to be a glitch in its verification systems that is affecting some people who utilize text messages or automated phone calls as an added means of authentication.
We’re looking into account verification codes not being delivered via SMS text or phone call.
Sorry for the inconvenience, and we’ll keep you updated as we continue our work to fix this.

Meanwhile, numerous complaints have been piling up in the Twitter Support thread, with many people claiming that the bug isn’t exactly new.
Some users insist that they have been experiencing the issue for weeks, while others mentioned that the glitch has led to their accounts being suspended.
Users who rely on SMS messages or phone calls for two-factor authentication (2FA) can alternatively use a single-use back-up code that was generated by Twitter when they activated 2FA.
The recovery code can also be useful when you lose your phone, obviously assuming you saved the code in a secure place in the first place.
Generally speaking, while SMS-based 2FA is better than not using the added factor at all, the social media giant offers two more – and safer – 2FA authentication methods: an authentication app and a physical security key.
Twitter introduced 2FA back in 2013 but it wasn’t until last November that it stopped requiring users to supply their phone numbers when activating 2FA – even when they wanted to use either of the two safer methods.
