Dear Microsoft Customer,
Starting 12/11/2009 the ?Conficker?
worm began infecting Microsoft customers unusually rapidly.
Microsoft has been advised by your Internet provider that your network is infected.
To counteract further spread we advise removing the infection using an antispyware program.
We are supplying all effected Windows Users with a free system scan in order to clean any files infected by the virus.
Please install attached file to start the scan.
The process takes under a minute and will prevent your files from being compromised.
We appreciate your prompt cooperation.
Regards, Microsoft Windows Agent #2 (Hollis) Microsoft Windows Computer Safety Division
Figures at Virus Radar, a resource we maintain to track threats circulating as email attachments, indicates an infection ratio of 0.036% today, putting it a close second to Win32/Zafi.B.
While these aren't the sort of volumes we regarded as high in the early noughties, that's a substantial ratio these days, when email attachments are not a particularly common vector.
