Recently, Randy Abrams and I were drafted in after the original contributors moved on, and we started contributing this week:
Poachers and Gamekeepers considers whether there is a conflict of interest when AV companies work with companies and individual s who are or have been active in the malware research field to the point of writing "malicious" code, in response to some very pertinent ethical questions asked by Kurt Wismer.
Randy asks Who are the cybercriminals?, observing that there are many more types of cybercriminal than those who make the big splash headlines.

Hopefully, a few more people will contributing in the near future.
