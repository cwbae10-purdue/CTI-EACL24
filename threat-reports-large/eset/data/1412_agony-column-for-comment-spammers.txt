Dear Holidays 2012, you placed the following comment on one of Mr. Harley's blogs:
I’m having some problems with Firefox, so I want to uninstall it and then reinstall it.
But I want to save all my bookmarks, so can I save my bookmarks to my computer, and then import them back to Firefox once I reinstall it?
Thanks for the help..
If you haven't managed to find the import/export functions in the Firefox bookmark manager, maybe your problems with Firefox aren't going to be solved by reinstalling.
(Hint: you might find it in the bookmarks menu.)
Perhaps next time you ask one of these "duh" questions in the hope that we'll approve your comment and publicise your website, you could make it somehow connected to the blog you are commenting on or at least related to computer security in general?
But we still won't approve it, with or without your URL.

Dear public adjuster florida, your question was:
I wanna write stuuf like journals or bloggs, but not saying who I really am.
Is there any website where I can do this?
Websites for blogging or writing journals and get to post them online?.
There are indeed such pages.
Sometimes we call them blog sites.
However, before you go off and google, you might want to work on your spelling and grammar a bit.

Thank you, Letitia.
I'll look forward to the next time they let you out of the HR office.
The point of this approach to comment spamming is, I suppose, to ask a question so dumb that even the greenest newbie can answer it, even though it has nothing to do with the blog topic.
I suspect that Letitia will be back.
