Before I started today's flurry of blogs, I was uncharacteristically quiet: first I was at an AMTSO event in San Mateo, then at RSA in San Francisco, and then in darkest Shropshire for reasons that won't interest you in the least.
I was planning to put up some news about the AMTSO workshop by now, but in view of some recent developments, I'm going to hold back on that for a few days.
However, I will at least take the opportunity to thank Jong Purisima and the guys at Webroot for looking after us so well.
The following week I was at RSA.
It was a particular pleasure to see Eddy Willems, Paul Ducklin, Chester Wisniewski, Alan Shimel, Pavel Baudis et al at the Security Bloggers Meet-Up, and many of the Great and Good at ESET at the SC Awards dinner.
I also spent some time around the ESET booth.
Nice to catch up with so many of the people I mostly only see when I get to San Diego, and I particularly enjoyed Randy Abrams' presentation on some of the more dramatic security slip-ups of the past few years.
I was going to refer to some of the content of presentations I heard (notably the case studies by Dwayne Melançon and Chris Larsen), and some of the off-site events I got to, but that will have to wait now till I've got through a bit more of the work that was piling up while I was out of office.
First, though, there's an item from my colleagues in Spain that I think you might find interesting.
