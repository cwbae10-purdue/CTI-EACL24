Presenting a recorded webinar that seeks to answer this question: How is the landscape changing for cybersecurity and what do businesses need to know to protect themselves?
The cybersecurity outlook for 2015 was the subject of a webinar that I recorded last week, and which you can access below.
Quite a few people who watched the presentation have requested copies of the slides.
I have made these available on SlideShare.
But I also thought it would be helpful to provide people with a link to the recorded webinar because it seems to be popular (it was rated 4.3/5.0 by more than 60 viewers).
About 150 people watched it live, 400 more have watched the recording.
In the webinar I tried to answer this question: How is the cybersecurity threatscape changing and what do businesses need to know to protect themselves?
Of course, there are many “looks ahead” at this time of year.
I try to read as many as I can to help me I decide on the top items to cover.
I also get input from my colleagues.
However, I’m sure I missed some things.
I wanted to say more about cloud.
And also about cybercrime legislation.
I don’t think I sounded optimistic about the prospects for legislative action in the U.S. in 2015, but then President Obama kicked things up a notch this week, and I am now more hopeful.
In any event, I hope you find this webinar helpful.
