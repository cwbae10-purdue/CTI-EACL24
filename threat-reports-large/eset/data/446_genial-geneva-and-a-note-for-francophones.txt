Well, I am in Switzerland, and very close to the French border, for the Virus Bulletin conference – perhaps the most eagerly anticipated event in the anti-malware researcher’s calendar.
How sad is that?
I also thought you might like to further extend your French skills on an article here, about a presentation
Bonjour mes amis!
Well, I am in Switzerland, and very close to the French border, for the Virus Bulletin conference – perhaps the most eagerly anticipated event in the anti-malware researcher’s calendar.
How sad is that?
I also thought you might like to further extend your French skills on an article here, about a presentation Pierre-Marc made at our offices in Bratislava: http://www.globalsecuritymag.fr/Voyage-au-coeur-du-Cyber-crime,20090918,12795.html.
I think that means “A voyage to the heart of cyber-crime”, but my French is about forty years rusty.
