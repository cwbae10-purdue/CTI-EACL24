For anyone who ever learnt C programming back in school, you will, like me, probably have started out with the seminal text "The C Programming Language" written by Ritchie and Brian Kernigan.
Ritchie was the co-creator of the C language – which is arguably the foundation of much of the modern software we use (though in many cases it has been superseded by Object Oriented languages, particularly C++) – but he was also one of the inventors of the UNIX operating system.
He may not have been as charismatic or as well known as Steve Jobs, who passed last week, but he is arguably as important in the history of computing.
ESET expresses our sincerest sympathies to Dennis Ritchie's friends and family.
