Google has just introduced a new feature for users to make its two-step verification (2SV) process easier.
Users can now receive notifications asking them if they are trying to access their accounts, to which they can simply tap ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
This new process still requires users to be close to their phones, but it leaves less room for mistakes and is undoubtedly quicker.
Keep in mind that even if you already use 2SV, you still have to turn this service on by logging into Google, going to My Account > Sign-in & security > Signing in to Google > 2-step Verification.
This service is only available to users of Android or iPhone 5s or later, and you will need to have the Google app installed on your phone.
This is just one of many account-access innovations that Google is expected to roll out over the next few years.
In December, it was revealed that Google has been testing a new way to sign into their accounts, which entirely eliminates the need for passwords.
