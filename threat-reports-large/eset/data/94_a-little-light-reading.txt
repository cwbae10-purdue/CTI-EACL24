I’ve just found out that I have another book out.
Well, a single chapter in a three volume set called The Handbook of Computer Networks.
(The chapter is on E-Mail Threats and Vulnerabilities: thank you for asking.)
“I’ve just found out…” probably sounds quite disingenuous.
How could anyone not know they had a book published?

Well, the pace can be astonishingly leisurely in academic publishing.
I was invited to write it in 2005, and returned the corrected copy-edits last summer, and apparently it came out in December: I didn’t know that until I mailed the Editor-in-Chief to ask how the project was going.
That’s not the longest incubation period for a book that I’ve experienced, though.
An article I wrote in 2000 for the American Society for Industrial Society turns out to have been repackaged in 2005 as an eBook.
As far as I know, you can still buy it, but I’m not going to recommend it.
Apart from the fact that I don’t get any money for it (what am I doing wrong that JK Rowling is doing right?
), it’s very dated.
The malware scene has changed a bit since 2000, and if they’d actually asked or even told me about the eBook, I’d have suggested that it needed updating if they were going to charge $5.95 for it.
The Handbook of Computer Networks is a little more up-to-date – well, as up-to-date as you can expect an accumulation of three-year-old chapters to be – and a lot more expensive.
Don’t feel you have to go out and spend $750 for my benefit, though.
I don’t get any of the money.
Just a copy of the book and some witty remarks from my wife about not needing any more doorstops.
But I know what my next book is going to be.
