Do you realize that potentially everything you type and read may be public information?

I was checking a hotel business center computer this weekend.
I found some interesting stuff.
A military document for a local air force base.
It wasn’t classified.
The confidential test results for a semi-synthetic lubricant, the sales figures for a medical supplier and an aircraft flight log.
On the personal side I found a Yahoo email message with a purchase confirmation that included the person’s name, address, email address, a link to their online purchase account and what they bought.
There was a letter to “one of the other women”.
A picture of a cute young girl she took with her cell phone in a fitting room was amusing.
At least she was fully clothed.
When you use a business center computer, a library computer, or any public computer it is safest to assume that all you type and read is public information.
For that reason I never use such computers for banking, email, VPN access, or anything with a password.
