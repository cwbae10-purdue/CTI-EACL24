LastPass has gone public about a couple of security holes that were found in its popular online password management software.
That’s enough to send a shiver down the spines of the many internet users who trust the service to store its passwords securely, but the company says that there is no need to panic.
LastPass has gone public about a couple of security holes that were found in its popular online password management software.
That’s enough to send a shiver down the spines of the many internet users who trust the service to store its passwords securely, but the company says that there is no need to panic.
In a blog post entitled “A note from LastPass”, the company has given brief details of the flaws found in its password manager for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari.
(By the way, do you feel as cynical as me about how some vendors reporting security vulnerabilities in their products love to downplay the seriousness by not referring to any words like “security” or “vulnerability” in the headlines of their advisories?)
The first vulnerability isn’t really in the main LastPass product at all, but instead in an add-on known as Bookmarklets.
LastPass Bookmarklets are small snippets of JavaScript code that install as a bookmark of “favourite” in your browser.
Chances are that you would only be using Bookmarklets if you wish to integrate LastPass more tightly with the mobile Safari browser on iOS, or if you weren’t using one of the major browsers that LastPass officially supports.
If you click on a Bookmarklet, you can execute code on the webpage that you’re viewing.
That could, of course, be useful if there is a login form on the webpage and no other easy way to access your password manager, but what happens if the webpage you are running the code on is itself malicious?
Zhiwei Li, a security researcher at UC Berkeley, found a method by which (if a user clicked a bookmarklet while visiting an untrustworthy website) passwords for other sites could be extracted from LastPass and put in the hands of criminal hackers.
