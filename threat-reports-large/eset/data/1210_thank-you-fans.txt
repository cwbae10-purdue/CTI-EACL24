So, a (long) while ago I wrote about the Haiti earthquake, with some commentary about the intersection between natural disasters, Black Hat SEO, scare tactics for education in good security practice, plus some links relevant to the earthquake.
Well, I'm certainly not ashamed of that blog, though I haven't thought about it for a long time,

Well, I'm certainly not ashamed of that blog, though I haven't thought about it for a long time, but it appears that I underestimated its importance.
One comment I've just come across (yes, we do read comments before we approve them) tells me that I'm extremely great and that this is a wonderful website.
Well, I can't argue with that, but since the sender's address is a very obvious fake and the post shows no evidence that "she" actually read the article, that one is dead and gone.
Plonk!!
!
But what do I do with this?
"I have to express thanks to this writer for rescuing me from such a scenario.
Because of surfing around throughout the online world and seeing concepts that were not productive, I figured my life was well over….It’s possible to at this point look ahead to my future…."
Having rescued "Terry" from the Slough of Despond, how can I possibly discard this as comment spam, just because it doesn't appear to have anything to do with the original post?
Just like this.
Ploooooonkkkkkk!!!!!!!!

It does sometimes seem like the most fulsome praise we get is from comment spammers trying to slip spammy (or worse) URLs past us.
