Cyberattacks are “no longer the stuff of spy thrillers” – they are now a very serious threat to individuals, organizations and economies.
Cyberattacks are “no longer the stuff of spy thrillers” – they are now a very serious threat to individuals, organizations and economies.
This is according to Ben Gummer, the UK’s minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, who added in an article for Telegraph that “sophisticated actors” now have the ability to impact on essential services.
In his piece, which was released to coincide with the UK government’s £1.9 billion cybersecurity boost, he said that everyone, from businesses and individuals, has a “duty” to keep safe and secure from cybercriminals.
“For companies, charities and universities, cyberattacks must now be seen as another serious operational risk that all organizations need to manage,” Gummer continued.
“In the same way they make provision for power cuts, floods, fire, theft and terrorist attacks.”
Efforts to bolster security at all levels must be made, the MP added.
For individuals, this can be as simple as using stronger passwords – passphrases, it must be noted, are also highly recommended – and regularly updating software.
Gummer also highlighted the government’s responsibility in leading by example.
As public services increasingly migrate online, citizens need to feel confident that sensitive information in this space remains safe from cyberattacks.
“We have a solemn responsibility to ensure that we have the best possible cybersecurity,” he stated in his article for the newspaper.
