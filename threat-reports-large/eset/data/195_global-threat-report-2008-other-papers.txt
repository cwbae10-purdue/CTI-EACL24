We’ve also been doing a little tidying of the white papers page, and there will be some additional material there in the near future, including papers on fake antimalware, the apparently late but unlamented Storm botnet, some of our recent conference papers on testing, malware naming, and user education, and an independent paper on spotting implementational errors in comparative tests that has also been referenced in the AMTSO document on The Fundamental Principles of Testing.
AMTSO (The Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization) will be considering a number of additional documents next month, on a number of test-related topics, as well as the “terms of engagement” for the newly-appointed Reviews of Reviews board.
