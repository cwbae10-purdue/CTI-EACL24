Another week, another scheme from the Nuwar gang.
We started receiving reports early this morning that new variants of Nuwar are being advertised through spam.
Some of the e-mail subjects include “Please open your ecard.” and “This ecard is hillarious!”.
The e-mail contains, as usual, a very simple text and a link to a host
Another week, another scheme from the Nuwar gang.
We started receiving reports early this morning that new variants of Nuwar are being advertised through spam.
Some of the e-mail subjects include “Please open your ecard.” and “This ecard is hillarious!”.
The e-mail contains, as usual, a very simple text and a link to a host infected by Nuwar that acts as a proxy to serve malware.
The malicious page doesn’t include any exploits this time.
It simply tries to convince visitors to download and execute a file called “ecard.exe” or postcard.exe.
After execution, the executable writes two files in the C:windowssystem32 folder.
One file called diperto.ini, this is the peer-to-peer configuration file.
The other file is called dipertoXXXX-XXX.sys where the ‘X’ are random number and letters.
This is the system driver that injects code into other processes and has rootkit capabilities to hide this malware.
