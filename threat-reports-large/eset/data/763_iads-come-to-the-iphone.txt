There are a number of features in iPhone OS version 4.
The operating system being able to multitask, like Android and other smartphones do.
Corporate administrators will be able to push out updates instead of users being required to use iTunes to patch their iPhones.
Users will be able to click on attachments and launch them automatically.
The new OS also features an advertising platform called “iAds”.
Malicious advertisements have been a problem in the PC arena, but Apple is doing this a bit differently.
In addition to keeping 40% of the advertising Apple will host the ads.
By hosting the ads, not only does Apple make money, but they can also do a good job of making sure that malicious ads do not get through, and if one does they can pull it.
The multitasking capability will make it easier for malware to run, especially on iPhones that have been jailbroken, but when vulnerabilities are found in the OS itself, the exploits can potentially be much more powerful.
It will be interesting to see what the hackers discover when they start looking at iPhone OS 4.
