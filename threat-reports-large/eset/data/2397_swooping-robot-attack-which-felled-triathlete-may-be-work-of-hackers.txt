A competitor in an Australian triathlon was hospitalized with injuries and “pieces of propeller in her head” after a drone plunged from the sky, causing head injuries.
The competitor, Raija Ogden was treated by paramedics at the scene after the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) suddenly plunged from the sky, hitting her on the head.
The UAV had been filming the race.
The vehicle, a helicopter-style ‘drone’ may have been attacked by hackers, according to the owner of New Era Photography and Film, who said the incident appeared to be “suspicious”, according to local paper Everything Geraldton.
“We are currently in discussions with the videographers to assess how the incident occurred and the circumstances surrounding the accident,” the drone’s owner, Warren Abrams, said.
Sky News reported that Abrams claims that initial investigations show that someone “channel hopped” the aerial device – making it uncontrollable.
Abrams claimed that a similar incident had affected the drone earlier in the day.

Network World reported that Ogden said, “I have lacerations on my head from the drone and the ambulance crew took a piece of propeller from my head.
My hair was completely red with blood.
