Updated information on ESET presentations at Virus Bulletin 2014.
Further to the blog I put up a few days ago – Virus Bulletin, AVAR conferences: a tasty Conference Pair – the paper Bootkits: past, present & future, written by ESET’s Eugene Rodionov, Intel’s Aleksandr Matrosov (formerly of ESET), and myself, has now been promoted to the main programme.
It will be presented by Eugene and Alex on Thursday 25th September between 09:30 and 10:00 in the Red room.
At 12.00 on the same day, Robert Lipovsky and Anton Cherepanov will present their last minute paper on Back in BlackEnergy: 2014 targeted attacks in the Ukraine and Poland.
Look out for more information on that in a forthcoming blog by Robert.
And, of course, I already mentioned these other presentations, but here they are again just so that the information is all in the same place:
On Wednesday 24th at 11.30, ESET Canada’s Pierre-Marc Bureau co-presents a paper with Evgeny Sidorov and Konstantin Otrashkevich from the Yandex Safe Search team on Ebury and CDorked.
Full disclosure.
At 14.30 on Wednesday, ESET Canada researcher Jean-Ian Boutin presents his paper about The evolution of webinjects.
