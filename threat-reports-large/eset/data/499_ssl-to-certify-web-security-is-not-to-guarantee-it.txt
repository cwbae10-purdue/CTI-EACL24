Hard on the heels of the translated blog by Sebastián Bortnik that I posted at the weekend comes news from the Register (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/05/fraudulent_paypay_certificate_published/) of a bogus Paypal SSL certificate released yesterday exploiting a bug in Microsoft’s crypto API that has remained unpatched for more than two months, when Moxie Marlinspike (can I have a handle like that, please?)
demonstrated his “universal wildcard certificate” at Blackhat.
(Sebastian also referred to this attack in the blog we posted earlier, but here’s that link again: “Null Attacks Against Prefix SSL Certificates” at http://www.thoughtcrime.org/papers/null-prefix-attacks.pdf.)
Dan Goodin of the Register suggests that this is your cue to switch to Firefox, which doesn’t use the vulnerable API used by Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Apple Safari – who says there’s no cooperation between the big players?
