Blackmailers force internet site Code Spaces out of business, leaving customers in the lurch.
In the last few weeks there have been numerous stories of online criminals launching attacks against businesses with the aim of extorting money from their victims.
For instance, some 650,000 Domino’s Pizza customers in France and Belgium were put at risk after hackers made off with a customer database, and demanded the restaurant paid up a hefty ransom or face having the stolen data made public.
It has also been revealed that mobile phone giant Nokia had, a few years back, found itself in the uncomfortable position of handing over millions of dollars to blackmailing hackers who had stolen encryption codes for the Symbian operating system, and were threatning to post them online.
Unfortunately, a police sting designed to catch Nokia’s blackmailers is said to have failed after officers lost track of both the criminals and the cash.
More recently, RSS aggregator Feedly admitted it had been hit by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack which took its service offline, and announced that it was refusing to pay the ransom demanded by the blackmailing hackers.
At the same time it was being reported that Evernote and music service Deezer were also suffering from DDoS attacks against their systems.
Of course, all of these companies have recovered and will – hopefully – be able to parry any future attacks more successfully without disruption or inconvenience to their users.
The same, sadly, can not be said of the latest DDoS extortion victim: Code Spaces.
