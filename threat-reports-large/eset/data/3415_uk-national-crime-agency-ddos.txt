Last week, users of Lizard Squad’s DDoS-on-demand service were feeling the heat after arrests were made by UK police.
This week, it’s the UK’s National Crime Agency which has found itself the victim of a denial-of-service attack.
Last week, after British police arrested six people in relation to alleged distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks conducted with the LizardStresser tool, the National Crime Agency (NCA) tweeted a stark warning to those attempting to disrupt websites by overloading them with traffic.
The inventive cybercops re-used the Lizard Squad hacking gang’s monocle-wearing, pipe-smoking, top hat-wearing mascot to warn potential users of its DDoS-on-demand service that they might expect a visit from the boys in blue.
