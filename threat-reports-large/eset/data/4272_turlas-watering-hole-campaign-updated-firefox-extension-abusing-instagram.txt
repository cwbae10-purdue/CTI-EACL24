The Turla espionage group is still using watering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&C infrastructure.
Update, 21 June 2017: Due to our misunderstanding of communications with Google, the Firefox extension’s infection vector discussed below was wrongly described here on 06 June 2017; this is now corrected.
Apologies to Google and our readers for the unintentional misrepresentation in our original post.
Some of the tactics used in APT attacks die hard.
A good example is provided by Turla’s watering hole campaigns.
Turla, which has been targeting governments, government officials and diplomats for years – see, as an example, this recent paper – is still using watering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&C infrastructure.
In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014 with very few variations in their modus operandi.
A watering hole attack compromises websites that are likely to be visited by targets of interest.
The people behind Turla are apparently keen on targeting embassy websites.
Indeed, there was a February 2017 blogpost by Forcepoint highlighting some of the websites most recently compromised.
We, of course, are monitoring the developments of these campaigns closely and recently noticed them reusing a technique that we haven’t seen them use for several months.
In the IoCs section below, there is a list of websites that have been used to redirect to Turla watering hole C&Cs in the past.
As is usual with this group, there are many websites directly related to embassies throughout the world.
