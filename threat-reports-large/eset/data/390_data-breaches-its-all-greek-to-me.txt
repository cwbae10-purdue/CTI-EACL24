Data Breaches continue to be a huge problem: Eight-five percent of organizations surveyed had had at least 1 data breach in the last 12 months, demonstrating that there is no let up in breaches as this is consistent with 84 percent sited [sic] in the 2008 report.
Companies suffering more than 5 data breaches rose to 22 percent in 2009 up from 13 percent in 2008.
More than 70% have fully executed or just launched data encryption strategy in their organization.

The majority of organizations, 78 percent, have some type of encryption strategy, up from 74 percent in 2008 and from 66 percent in 2007.
Encryption of data on mobile data-bearing devices used by employees is very important or important.
More than 59 percent of respondents say it is very important or important to encrypt employees’ mobile devices – a sign that organizations recognize that valuable data is more mobile than ever.
