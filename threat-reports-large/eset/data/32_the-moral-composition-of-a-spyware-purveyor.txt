FTC Commissioner Jon Leibowitz voted against the deal because he alleges that DirectRevenue was still keeping about 20 million dollars in ill-gotten gains.
What is interesting is the mind set of DirectRevenue.
Back in April 2006 a company spokesperson was quoted on the DirectRevenue web site as saying:
“This lawsuit is a baseless attempt by the Office of the Attorney General to rewrite the rules of the adware business.
It focuses exclusively on the company’s past practices – practices we and other industry leaders changed long ago – and says not a word about what we’re doing today…” (http://www.direct-revenue.com/news23.php)
So, is this the model of a defense?
“Your honor, I stopped breaking into cars and houses people after those 20,000 incidents and the prosecutor is only focusing on what I did in the past, not what I do today.
I am proud of 200 consecutive days without breaking and entering”
