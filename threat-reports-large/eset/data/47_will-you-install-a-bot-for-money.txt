SETI@home (http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/) and Folding@home (http://folding.stanford.edu/) are interesting, if not cool uses of technology, but they do bear a striking resemblance to a nefarious threat called a botnet.
Now with Sony contemplating a commercial “PS3 Grid” (http://blogs.pcworld.com/digitalworld/archives/2007/04/sony_looking_to.html) one wonders where the lines will blur.

There are similarities between a botnets, SETI, Folding@home.
The term botnet is used to describe a collection of PCs that are remotely controlled without the knowledge and/or consent of the owner.
Purpose, awareness, and consent are the primary differentiators between botnets and SETI or Folding@home.
Botnets and the proposed PS3 grids would bot involve the use of remotely controlled distributed networks of home computing equipment to make money.
The fact that the user is able to make a choice to participate is a significant differentiator but this does not eliminate risk.
In the botnet world it is not uncommon to find botnets stolen from bad guys by bad guys.
In a commercial context, control of a network of computers is a concern.
If a hacker can break into the network, then the functionality of the client software and the operating system will determine the amount of control a remote hacker would have over the end user PS3’s.
