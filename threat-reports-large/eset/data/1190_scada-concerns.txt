Greetings, my faithful fans.
Did you miss me?
I've just had a restful week hiding from the Internet in a remote cottage in Devon, which is why I've been uncharacteristically quiet.
Before that, though, I had an interesting and useful week in London mostly centred round the Infosec Europe expo, where apart from wall-to-wall meetings
Greetings, my faithful fans.
Did you miss me?
I've just had a restful week hiding from the Internet in a remote cottage in Devon, which is why I've been uncharacteristically quiet.
Before that, though, I had an interesting and useful week in London mostly centred round the Infosec Europe expo, where apart from wall-to-wall meetings and general networking, I presented in the Business Strategy Theatre on "Infrastructure Attacks: the Next Generation."
At some point, I plan to work my speaker notes into a white paper, but the presentation itself is now up at http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/Scared-for-Scada-Post-Infosec.pdf.
