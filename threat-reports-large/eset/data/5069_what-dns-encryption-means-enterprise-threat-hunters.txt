The dawn of the DNS over HTTPS era is putting business security and SOC teams to the challenge
In one way, the proliferation of domain name service (DNS) attacks throughout the world has helped to raise awareness about a deep problem in the “plumbing” of the internet.
The infrastructure behind the DNS suffers from a lack of built-in security that is putting internet users at risk.
Decades of work on the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) specifications have been ongoing in a concerted effort to find a better way of securing the DNS while keeping it flexible enough for upscaling into enterprise, and even larger, networks.
DNSSEC uptake, however, has been sluggish in most countries.
Perhaps out of impatience for the incremental successes of DNSSEC, some have begun turning to new methods to secure DNS traffic, such as DNS over TLS (DoT), DNSCrypt, DNSCurve and, most recently, DNS over HTTPS (DoH).
Currently, we are witnessing a battle for control over the DNS with a push for securing the DNS over HTTPS.
Since, traditionally, DNS requests and replies are sent in plain text, security operations center (SOC) teams overseeing corporate networks are able to monitor the domains being queried and block users from accessing malicious domains.
Plain text DNS requests are certainly less private but intelligence from the DNS level has always been a critical data source for supervising the security of a network.
With the introduction of DoH, DNS requests are encrypted via the HTTPS protocol, thus hiding them from the easy oversight of network defenders.
Leaving aside other aspects of DoH, such as privacy and centralization of control over the internet, let’s discuss how the security of private and public networks is affected.
