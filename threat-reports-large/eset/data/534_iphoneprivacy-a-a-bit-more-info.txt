It’s written in Python (as was some of the previous code that uses this approach to gaining access to jailbroken iPhones with SSH installed) , and Python is highly portable and open source.
(It’s also available for Java and .NET and even MS-DOS, if you’re that sad.)
Don’t get complacent about the fact that Python is an interpreted language, either: there are compilers and translators that make it perfectly possible to distribute executable packages on a system that doesn’t come with the interpreter installed.
