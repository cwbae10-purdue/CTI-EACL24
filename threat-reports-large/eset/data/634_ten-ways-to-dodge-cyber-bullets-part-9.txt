Be Wireless, not Careless
Don’t connect to just any “free Wi-Fi” access point: it might alter your DNS queries or be the “evil twin” of a legitimate access point, set up to intercept your logins and online transactions.
(When I have occasion to see what networks are being offered me in hotels, airports, even in the apartment block where I live, I have to wonder how many of them are legitimate…)
Our colleagues in Bratislava put up a nice article in 2009 on "Summer Surfing on Free Wi-Fi: Work or Play, but stay secured": see http://www.eset.eu/press/summer-surfing-on-free-wifi.
Of course, many of the points made there are just as valid at any time of year.
Here’s a summary of some of them:
Be aware of some common security issues with hot spots
“Evil twin” login interception: this is a scenario where a network is set up by hackers to resemble legitimate Wi-Fi hot spots, in order to intercept your login credentials for legitimate networks and sites
Previously unknown (zero-day) attacks exploiting operating system or application vulnerabilities
Sniffing , or using computer software and/or hardware to intercept and monitor traffic passing over a network
Other forms of data leakage using man-in-the-middle attacks
Be aware also of ways of reducing your attack surface and protect your computer:
Ensure VPN pass through ports are enabled, but don’t allow a high port free-for-all: professional system administrators open only necessary ports.
This doesn’t stop all attacks, but does reduce them.
Use HTTPS to access webmail
Avoid protocols that don’t include encryption wherever possible
Disable sharing of files, folders, services
Avoid connecting to sites that transfer sensitive info, your banking information, for instance, when connected to an untrusted access point
Ensure you’re using sound firewalling, antimalware, HIPS and so on.
