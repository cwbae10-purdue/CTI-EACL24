Greetings,
Topspot-Promotions, an established advertising company, would like to pay you for placing a small advertisement on blog.eset.com for one of our customers.
These days we are using a few methods of advertising to guarantee that the ad we choose will fit the site nicely.
After reviewing your website I thought about an advertisement that fits perfectly a few pages on your website.
For full details please contact me at ann.price@topspot-promotions.net.
*If you have other websites which I can review for advertising please send me their URLs as well.
Regards, Ann Price Advertising Specialist ann.price@topspot-promotions.net
To permanently delete yourself from our list, simply reply to this with a blank email and you will never receive any communication from us in the future.
For just a moment, let’s make the silly assumption that Topspot-Promotions is a legitimate company.
Malware in advertisements is a serious problem.
Companies like the New York Times have been bitten by this criminal ploy before.
No, we’re not going to place third party advertisements from a clown with an email account on our website.
But, I did a little more research.
This “established” advertising company registered their domain in late 2009.
Yeah, established, but not for very long.
According to 7zoom.com, topspot-promotions’ web site is worth $8,732 and they rank 300,039 in the world.
You just would expect more from a web promotion company.
I don’t know anything about 7zoom, but they say that ESET.com is worth $713,314 and ranks 3,573 in the world.
We’ll have to work on that.
According to http://under-over-soccer-picks.blogspot.com/2010/08/topspot-promotions-is-scam.html topspot-promotions doesn’t pay their bills either.
Not a good sign.
If you look at the website for topspot-promotions.net you will find that they do not publish a phone number or a physical address.
This should raise about a billion red flags.
Even if topspot had everything in order and a stellar reputation it is virtually certain that we would not place a third-party advertisement on our blog.
They did take the time to email me so I will share my polite response with you…
Hi Ann,
I'm glad you like our site.
One of our requirements for placing 3rd party ads on the blog, from a company like yours, is that NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) must have reported the temperature in Hades as being below 0 degrees Celsius for at least a week.
If you can provide a certified report we can talk.
I will say, you do come highly recommended though and I will certainly give your company coverage in our blog!!
