The Target breach, and in particular the role of respected security blogger Brian Krebs in breaking the story, has been optioned as a feature film by Sony.

The Target breach, and in particular the role of respected security blogger Brian Krebs in breaking the story, has been optioned as a feature film by Sony.
The studio has bought the rights to the New York Times article, “Reporting From the Web’s Underbelly,” which told Krebs’ story in the wake of his exclusive revelations about the data breach at Target.
The Hollywood Reporter writes that the studio envisions the story as a “cyber thriller” set in the “high stakes world” of cybercrime.
Mashable reports that the studio has recruited Richard Wenk, writer of its recent version of The Equalizer, and action sequel The Expendables 2, to write the script.
Krebs’ blog, Krebs on Security, broke the story of the Target breach late last year, revealing that a large number of American debit and credit card details had been leaked from the retailer.
The story had been leaked to Krebs, a former reporter at the Washington post, via officials at American credit card issuers.
