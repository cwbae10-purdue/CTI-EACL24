A hacker who broke into celebrity email accounts and leaked nude pictures of Hollywood actors, including Scarlett Johansson, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to an Associated Press report.
Christopher Chaney, 35, was arrested three years after he began his campaign of hacking into private accounts and leaking intimate photos of Hollywood stars including Christina Aguilera, Mila Kunis, as well as Johansson, star of Lost in Translation and The Avengers.
Prosecutors said that he accessed more than 50 email accounts between November 2010 and October 2011.
He didnâ€™t only target the rich and famous but the accounts of women he knew personally.
In one case he sent a nude picture of a co-worker to her father.
