CeCOS, to be held in Prague between 25-27 April,will again look at operational issues and the development of communal resources for first responders and forensic professionals.
[Updated to repair a glitch in the registration link.]
I’ve had a long if intermittent association with the Anti-Phishing Working Group, going back to the early noughties when I represented the UK’s National Health Service there for a while, and subsequently as an individual member and through my association with ESET.
Its focus has widened from the relatively crude phishing emails of that time to embrace a wider range of cybercrime.
Sadly, I’ve never yet managed to get to one of the CeCOS (Counter eCrime Operations Summit) meetings with which APWG is associated.
Unfortunately, the 6th CeCOS, to be held in Prague (one of my favourite cities…) between 25-27 April, is going to be no exception, since I have to be at Infosec Europe.
The conference will again look at operational issues and the development of communal resources for first responders and forensic professionals, as you may gather from some key presentations:
Toward a Universal eCrime Taxonomy for Industry and Law Enforcement; by Iain Swaine, Ensequrity.
Budapest Convention on Cybercrime: Transborder Law Enforcement Access to Data; by Alexander Seger, Director of the Data Protection and Cybercrime Division of the Council of Europe.
Adventures in Cybercrime Event Data Sharing; by Pat Cain, AWPG Resident Research Fellow.
However, the working agenda includes plenty of other notable researchers and speakers like Jart Armin, Luis Corrons, Larry Bridwell and Gary Warner.
The conference defines its aims as “to identify common forensic needs, in terms of the data, tools, and communications protocols required to harmonize cybercrime response across borders and between private sector financial and industrial sector responders and public sector policy professionals and law enforcement.”
