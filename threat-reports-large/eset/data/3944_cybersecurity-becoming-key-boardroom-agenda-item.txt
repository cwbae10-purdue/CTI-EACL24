An increase in the number of cyberattacks and growing awareness of the threat has made cybersecurity a key boardroom level consideration.
An increase in the number of cyberattacks and growing awareness of the threat has made cybersecurity a key boardroom level agenda item.
This is according to a new study from Marsh, which stated that there has been a discernable increase in the understanding of cyberthreats among board members.
In its paper, titled UK Cyber Risk Survey Report: 2016, it revealed that 71.8% of respondents have now included cyberthreats in their top-five or top-10 corporate risk registers.
Last year the figure was 45.8%.
There were other positive developments.
Marsh also found that 83% of respondents now have “a basic or complete understanding of their company’s exposure to cyber risk”.
In 2015 this was 60.8%.
“Increasing awareness is just part of the task facing UK organizations, however, and there is still a great deal of work to be done to improve understanding and management of cyber risk,” the authors of the paper commented.
“While it is encouraging that, today, 30.3% of UK businesses have board-level oversight of cyber risk – a 56% rise on the figure from 12 months ago – IT departments continue to take primary responsibility for the review and management of cyber risks in more than half (55.7%) of organizations.”
Marsh added that it was particularly concerned by the fact that 64.6% of UK enterprises have yet to look into the possible financial implications of a cyberattack.
This paper comes on the back of a similar collaborative study from BT and KPMG, which suggested that businesses need to be aware of the “industrialization of cybercrime”.
