Breaking into the music business is one thing.
Breaking into Madonna’s computer without permission is quite another.
Late last year, Madonna logged furiously into her Instagram account in order to complain that hackers had broken into her computer, and stolen photographs and music tracks.
Madonna’s plans for a Spring 2015 launch for her album “Rebel Heart” were allegedly thrown into chaos by the hack, which saw “early, leaked demos” of some of the album tracks released onto the internet.
In an attempt to minimise any damage, the savvy queen of pop released six songs early on iTunes, which adoring fans lapped up.
It didn’t take long for the police to get involved, and within a month a suspect was arrested by Israeli police.
In a bizarre twist, the man arrested by Israeli cops was 39-year-old Adi Lederman, who had appeared on Israel’s “Kochav Nolad” (“A Star Is Born”) TV talent show.
For the record, the TV show’s judges described Lederman’s performance as “painful”.
When Lederman was voted off the show he is said to have focused his fury in Madonna’s direction, hacking into a cloud account run by a member of the Material Girl’s team, stealing an early version of “Give Me All Your Luvin'” from her earlier MDNA album.

Breaking into Madonna’s computer without permission is quite another.
As the Jerusalem Post reports, Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court hit Lederman with a 14 month sentence on Thursday as part of a plea bargain deal.
By all accounts, Lederman had returned to his hacking activities, breaking into email servers used by Kevin Antunes and Guy Oseary – Madonna’s musical director and talent manager respectively.
Once there, the hacker was able to obtain the necessary passwords to steal files from cloud-based accounts.
