[Update: so far I have two votes for dumb.
Maybe I'm giving this spammer too much credit, and it is a simple "spam template fail" ;-) On the other hand, while I wouldn't vote "evil genius", I'd still love to know how many people actually fall for this – I don't have a problem envisaging

Sophos's Graham Cluley has published a blog about his contender for "the dumbest malware attack he's seen this week": spammed malware received on the 19th March with an attachment that's supposed to be a Christmas card.
Well, I take his point: it does seem pretty stupid.
But let's think about this for a moment.
Of course, if you're reading this, you're probably cautious already about opening spammed attachments and less susceptible to this particular social engineering ploy (and, hopefully, running up-to-date security software which might well catch it).
But if you were one of the more naive or less well-informed people who do click on attachments without thinking too hard about it, would you be put off by the anachronistic timing?
Or would it make you more curious?
I think you might actually want to know who it was from and why it was so late.
What do you think?
