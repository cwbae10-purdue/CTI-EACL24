ESET is very interested in and supportive of the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO), which aims to raise testing standards across the board and reduce the impact of misleading, poorly-conceived and -implemented comparative testing.
Like many in the industry, we believe that benefits the end-user and the industry, and I’ve been heavily involved personally in some of the work that’s going on there.
One of those projects, a draft document [link removed as that draft is no longer available – DH, 2017] detailing what we believe to be (some of) the fundamental principles of sound testing has been put up at the AMTSO site, in the hope of getting feedback from a wider audience.
You’ll find an email address for sending comments to, or you can use the comment form at the AMTSO blog [link removed as no longer valid – DH, 2017].
Of course, that doesn’t mean we’re not interested if you want to comment on the subject here, too.
