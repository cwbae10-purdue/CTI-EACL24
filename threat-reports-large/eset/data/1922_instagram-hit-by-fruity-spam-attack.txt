Instagram users were bombarded with pictures of fruit over the weekend in a spam attack that swept the photo-sharing network.
Photographs of fruit began showing up in users’ feeds, linking to a fake BBC news page headlined, “”Tropical Fruit Burns 17 Pounds in 22 Days.
Exclusive Offer for Readers.” The spam photos were accompanied by messages such as “Ever seen this stuff?
I guess its super healthy, im giving it a try.
I saw it on Dr Oz’s show!
Link is in my bio #lovemyfollowers #health.”
The images linked to a page disguised by URL shortening service bit.ly.
Bit.ly has since placed a warning on the link.
Instagram confirmed the attack via email, according to a report on GigaOm, saying, “Earlier today a small portion of our users experienced a spam incident where unwanted photos were posted from their accounts.
Our security and spam team quickly took actions to secure the accounts involved, and the posted photos are being deleted.”
