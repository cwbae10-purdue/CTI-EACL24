There’s been a certain amount of buzz in the past couple of days about messages claiming to link to Wire Transfer information, but actually related to a Trojan commonly called Delf or Doneltart.
ESET is detecting the examples we’ve been seeing as a variant of Win32/TrojanDownloader.Delf.OZG.
The messages generally look something like this (at least, all the samples I’ve seen have).
The subject field takes the form:
Wire Transfer Info for <1stname> <2ndname>
The message looks like this:
For more details please download the invoice found on this link: [http://]<domain></folders>/transfer.php?name=<1stname><2ndname>
The link goes to a domain in Italy somewhat appropriately named after a region historically associated with violin making, or a subdomain thereof.
The fiddle in this case, of course, is that the link is to a Trojan Downloader, this being a very common payload for this family of malware, though some members have been seen to redirect web traffic or mess about with applications.
These messages may look familiar: the gang behind this malware family seems rather fond of social engineering around wire transfers, as a report going back to June from the Internet Storm Center indicates.
That’s because in this case at least, quite a few of the targeted domains are financial institutions, and on that occasion the message was along the lines of:
Please check the wire statement attached and let me know if everything is correct.
I am waiting for your reply.
Detection of this wave of malware seems to be reasonable, in general.
Here’s a VirusTotal report Pierre-Marc has sent me relating to one of the samples he’s seen (23 detections out of 41 products):

The hit rate varies between samples, though: I’ve seen reports as low as 16 for some, but NOD32 hasn’t failed to detect any of the samples I’ve tried subsequently (half a dozen or so, so far).
That doesn’t, of course, mean I can guarantee we have 100% detection!
The really encouraging thing about this issue has been the generous exchange of information between researchers on certain specialist lists.
Because of the nature of those lists, it’s best if I don’t name names (apart from Pierre-Marc of course!
), but you guys know who you are.
