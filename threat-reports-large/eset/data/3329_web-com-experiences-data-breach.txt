Web.com reveals that was the victim of a data breach this month, which affected up to 93,000 of its customers.
Web.com has revealed that one of its systems was attacked earlier this month, resulting in a major security breach.
The US-based company, which delivers internet services specifically to small businesses, said that up to 93,000 of its 3.3 million customers have been affected.
It explained that credit card information belonging to these customers, including the names and addresses to which they are affiliated, were compromised in the attack.
No social security numbers were affected, nor were other details taken, Web.com explained.
Current analysis of the incident suggests only credit card data has been accessed.
Web.com said that it made the discovery as part of its routine security monitoring.
On ascertaining that a breach had taken place, it “shut down access” and notified the authorities.
The company has since set up a dedicated online page for worried customers, answering key questions they may have about the incident.
“Web.com has very strong and sophisticated security measures in place to protect our computer systems and we regularly review and update our security protocols,” it was keen to highlight.
“Unfortunately, cybercrime is a persistent threat in today’s world.
Despite our best efforts, no business is immune.”
However, it stated that it is committed to protecting customer information and it will continue to “make significant investments in its internal security processes and systems to prevent incidents like this from occurring”.
