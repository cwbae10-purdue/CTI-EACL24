More than 30 photos of the celebrities have been posted on Twitter by a hacker who appears to have stolen the pictures from the iCloud account of Styles’s mother, Anne.
2014’s infamous “Celebgate” hack saw the intimate private photographs of Hollywood female celebrities leak online after hackers broke into their email, and scoop up images from their iCloud accounts.
High profile victims included Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Hudson, Rihanna and Kirsten Dunst.
In recent weeks, US law enforcement agencies have shared details of how celebrity email accounts were hacked through phishing attacks, and announced the guilty pleas of two men involved in the attacks.
But that isn’t quite the end of the story.
Because, sadly, it seems that some celebrities are still suffering, and having their privacy breached, as the result of online accounts being hacked.
The latest public figures to discover that their private photographs published online are One Direction singer Harry Styles and his alleged latest squeeze model/TV star Kendall Jenner.
More than 30 photos of the couple on vacation in St Bart’s have been posted on Twitter by a hacker who appears to have stolen the pictures from the iCloud account of Styles’s mother, Anne.
Fortunately – and perhaps understandably if the photos were indeed sourced from Harry’s mother’s iCloud account – the pictures appear to be fairly innocuous, and are nothing like as embarrassing as the intimate snaps revealed during CelebGate.
