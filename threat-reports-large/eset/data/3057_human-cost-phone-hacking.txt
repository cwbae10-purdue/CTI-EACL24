Phone hacking ruined the lives of celebrities, and – in at least one case – almost drove a victim to suicide.
How would you feel if a stranger was not only listening to your private voicemail messages, but then taking the information they gleaned from them and using it to write lurid, invasive news stories designed to sell tabloid newspapers?
My guess is that you would feel pretty wretched.
And yet, that’s an activity which some British newspapers engaged in for years in their rabid hunt forever-more salacious scoops and exclusives.
The activities of Rupert Murdoch’s News of the World in this area are well documented, and eventually resulted in the imprisonment of senior staff and the eventual closure of the newspaper entirely.
But you would be mistaken to think that only the disgraced News of the World was embroiled in the hacking of phone voicemail systems.
For instance, right now celebrity phone hacking victims are suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), the publishers of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, for damages.
And the testimonies of the public figures, describing the impact that phone hacking by Mirror journalists had on their lives, makes for uncomfortable reading.
