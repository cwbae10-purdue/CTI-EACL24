Money for nothing?
Don’t believe it: a variation on the Mystery Shopper scam that misuses the Pinecone Research brand.
Here’s an email I received recently.
I’ve been meaning to blog it for a while, but other stuff keeps getting in the way: nevertheless, it’s a pretty good example of a common scam.

Sounds tempting?
Maybe you’ve received this and thought of trying it out?
Don’t!
I’d never heard of PineCone Research – well, I don’t live in the US – but it turns out that they do indeed exist.
However, my scam detection antennae were waving furiously, so naturally I did some digging.
For a start, there were enough red flags in the headers to deter swimmers on every beach in California (like the forged sender-related fields).
It turns out, though, that if you follow through, you’ll be offered a check to be cashed so that you can proceed with your first assignment:
Carry out a Secret Survey on the nearest Western Union outlet in your location by forwarding a fixed amount {$1,550.00} to a “Mystery Consumer” in another region who’s conducting the same survey at the “Recipient” end.
[Information on the recipient of the money and the amount you can expect to be sent]
Your income is $150.00 for the survey.
You’re to deduct another $150.00 to cover the transfer charges (Money in Minutes) at the Western Union outlet.
That sounds like a generous rate for what you’re asked to do.
You’re to simply rate the Western Union outlet’s service by simply observing and recording the parameters below:
Outlet store Address: Appearance of Agent: Time taken to complete Transaction: Service: Friendliness: Efficiency: Future improvement you would like to see:
Upon completion of the survey you are to Immediately send us an E-mail with your rating of the outlet and the 10-Digit MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number) Nos of the transaction at Western Union which would be needed by the mystery consumer to complete her survey.
Then there’s similar sign-off text as in the previous mail, plus the claim that Pinecone Research is a proud member of the Better Business Bureau.
I’m not sure if that’s the case, but then his message isn’t from Pinecone Research at all.
Here’s how the scam works: the check is, of course, a fake.
The victim pays it in and goes ahead and follows the instructions, but the check subsequently bounces, and the victim is deemed responsible for the transaction and for any additional fees.
