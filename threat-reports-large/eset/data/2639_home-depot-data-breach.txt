Speaking on condition of anonymity, several employees from Home Depot’s security team said that the company had been repeatedly warned about the security of its sytems, and that the warnings stretched back to 2008, according to Ars Technica.
One employee said his concerns over credit card security at the store were so great he warned friends to use cash, rather than cards, in the store.
Other said that they resigned after they raised concerns over security issues, only to have them dismissed by managers.
Ars Technica reports that the chain hired Ricky Joe Mitchell as its senior IT security architect, after he had been fired by Enervest Operating in Charleston, which he responded to by sabotaging company systems and taking the company offline by 30 days.
He remained in charge of Home Depot’s security even after his indictment, until he pled guilty to federal charges in January 2014.
