Linux users should not fool themselves into believing that they are somehow magically immune from malware attacks.
I hope you weren’t one of the hundreds of people who downloaded a compromised version of the Linux Mint operating system on Saturday.
Because if you were, it’s possible that you’re not just running one of the more user-friendly flavours of Linux on your computer but also playing host to a Linux ELF trojan called Tsunami, that can be used to steal files from your system and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
In a blog post, Clement Lefebvre, leader of the Linux Mint project, warned that hackers had managed to break into the Linux Mint servers, and replace ISO download links to point to a compromised version of Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon edition, hosted on a Bulgarian FTP server.
Upon discovering the security problem, the Linux Mint team is thought to have cleaned-up its own site, only to have been compromised again via an insecure installation of WordPress.
In response, and while it was trying to get a proper handle on its vulnerabilities, the Linux Mint team wisely took linuxmint.com offline.
