The Trump Hotel Collection has once again suffered a data breach, according to a security expert.
Brian Krebs reported that banking industry sources have informed him that the chain, which belongs to the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has been the victim of another attack.
Mr. Krebs said that he was alerted to this story after three unnamed individuals in the financial sector had noticed a “pattern of fraud on customer credit cards.”
This, he elaborated, indicates that the cybercriminals have successfully managed to bypass security at some, if not all, of the properties that form the Trump Hotel Collection.
“We are in the midst of a thorough investigation on this matter,” Mr. Krebs quoted the company as saying.
“We are committed to safeguarding all guests’ personal information and will continue to do so vigilantly.”
The Trump Hotel Collection was previously attacked between May and June in 2015.
Mr. Krebs broke the news of this breach as well.
The company said at the time that an independent investigation into the breach revealed that no sensitive information belonging to its customers had been exposed.
It stated: “We believe that there may have been unauthorized malware access to some of the computers that host our front desk terminals and payment card terminals in our restaurants, gift shops and other point-of-sale purchase locations at some hotels managed by the Trump Hotel Collection.”
As Mr. Krebs noted in his expose, Mr. Trump has offered very little information about his plans for cybersecurity should he become the next US president.
