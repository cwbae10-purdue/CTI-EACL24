Well, I can understand his viewpoint, though given the sheer volume of security products these days, I’m not sure a small cluster of high profile events involving some major vendors really signifies that anti-malware maintenance standards have degraded.
To be honest, I was directly responsible for administering anti-malware products from 1989 to 2001, and indirectly responsible from 2001 to 2006 (even I couldn’t be personally responsible for maintaining three million machines!)
and I wouldn’t have compared any of the products I used to a dual carriageway.
Perhaps if any of those sites had used ESET products…
Based on that experience, and the certain knowledge that the job of maintaining a sound anti-malware solution is far more complex and resource-intensive than we’d have dreamt of it becoming in the early 90s, I’d say that the industry does pretty well, as a whole.
I remember Alan Solomon talking then about the glut problem, but our labs see something like 100,000 unique samples a day nowadays.
There aren’t many types of software that could accommodate such continuous pressure to update and upgrade with so few major problems.
