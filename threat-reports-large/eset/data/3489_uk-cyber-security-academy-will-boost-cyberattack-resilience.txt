The newly launched Cyber Security Academy in the UK will deliver comprehensive solutions and insight to all types of sophisticated cyberattacks.
A UK university has launched a Cyber Security Academy (CSA) to boost knowledge and understanding of cyberattacks.
The University of Southampton announced that the academy will help to make consumers, businesses and even the government “more resilient” to the growing threat of this complex crime.
Professor Vladimiro Sassone, director of the CSA at the University of Southampton, described this as a “timely initiative” that is “aligned” to the National Cyber Security Strategy.
“The span of problems is huge, including the protection of critical infrastructures, of industrial and economic processes, of government, businesses and users’ data, privacy and interests,” he said.
“There is a pressing demand for cybersecurity, and in the next 20 years cyber research will have the same kind of momentous social and economic impact as medical research had in the 20th century.”
The university intends for the CSA to become a globally influential institution, whereby an international team of academic staff will deliver innovative responses to cyberthreats.
There are four key ways in making this happen at the academy – research, innovation, training and outreach.
Also on offer is a tiered membership scheme, allowing for enterprises of all sizes to benefit from the expertise and insight offered by the CSA.
In turn, this inclusive approach will allow the academy to produce a wide-range of responses that are applicable to anyone and everyone.
This kind of comprehensive and catchall response is just what is needed to ensure that all stakeholders are protected.
