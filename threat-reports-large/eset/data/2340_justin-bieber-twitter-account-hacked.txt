Maybe it’s time to think twice before rushing to click on a link, next time your favourite celebrity says something bizarre on Twitter.
A few years ago I joked that the only reason I followed Britney Spears on Twitter was to get an early heads-up on when she next had her account hacked.
Actually, thinking back, I wasn’t joking.
It felt like barely a month went by without the singer having her account compromised.
And if her high profile account was exploited, chances were that plenty of her adoring fans were also likely to blindly click on the links without thinking of the possible consequences (too obvious ones being a phishing attack or a malware infection).
Here’s an example from January 2009, when Britney Spears had a lowly 14,000 followers.
(Today she has over 36 million.
Wow, hasn’t time moved on?)
Well, time has moved on and Britney’s superstar status has diminished a little.
After all, there are new kids on the block like Justin Bieber.
Bieber, who like the Britney of old appears to be going through a public car-crash for the benefit of the paparazzi, has an astonishing 50 million followers on Twitter.
And anyone with that kind of social media audience becomes an obvious attraction to social media scammers and online criminals.
Sure enough, this weekend, Justin Bieber appeared to be no longer in charge of his Twitter account – at least for a short time – as messages appeared in Indonesian linking to an Android app called Shooting Star Pro.
Within seconds, Bieber’s fanatical followers were favoriting and retweeting his message regardless, one assumes, of whether they were able to understand them.
Cemberut, by the way, is an Indonesian word meaning sullen or grumpy, and is sometimes used by social media users alongside downcast selfies of themselves.
What isn’t clear is how Bieber’s account was compromised.
