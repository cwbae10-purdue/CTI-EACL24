If you search for “Jacques tits” AND “Domain” you will find this scam has also been reported elsewhere.
When you receive an unsolicited email that you think may not be quite legitimate, or you think may be legitimate but you want to be sure, choose a few relatively unique and relevant terms from the message and search the web.
You can quickly find many scams this way.

This phrase comes from a common email scam that looks like this
