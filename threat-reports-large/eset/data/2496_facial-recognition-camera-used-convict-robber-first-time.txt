In a world-first case, biometric facial recognition software has been used to convict an armed robber, with a Chicago robber “matched” from CCTV footage to a mug shot and sentenced to 22 years in prison, according to the Chicago-Sun Times.
Pierre D Martin was sentenced this.
“This case is a great example that these high-tech tools are helping to enhance identification and lead us to defendants that might otherwise evade capture,” Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez said in a statement.
Sky News said that the case marked the first conviction obtained using NeoFace – face-recognition software purchased by the Chicago Police Department for $5.4m.
Engadget points out that the case has eerie echoes of the video game Watch Dogs – a cybercrime-heavy science fiction hit inspired in part by Chicago’s use of 22,000 face-recognition cameras.
We Live Security recently took a look at the realism – or otherwise – of the video game’s world of all-seeing cameras and super-powered smartphone apps.
Martin was convicted of two robberies, according to Engadget’s report.
In one, he was captured on video on Chicago’s Pink Line trains on February 9 2013, pulling a gun and demanding the cell phone of a man listening to music on headphones.
Martin had earlier robbed a man at the same station.
He was also a convicted felon, according to the Sun-Times.
The software used to “match” Martin’s image to a database of several million police mugshots was made by NEC, according to Silicon Republic’s report.
