A young lady is so impressed with me that she wants to share our heart's desires.
Take a look… she sent it in two languages to make sure I would understand her.

I was greeted with the most charming email this morning.
A young lady is so impressed with me that she wants to share our heart's desires.
Take a look… she sent it in two languages to make sure I would understand her.
Ahh, but then I checked out who the email was sent to… It seems I’m just another “undisclosed recipient”.
This is a common scam, but usually the guy pretending to be a woman has enough brain cells left to actually address the email to the recipient.
No doubt a response would elicit another email claiming that “she” is in a refugee camp and needs help accessing millions of dollars.
We’ll test my theory.
I replied with the following…
Hi Binta,
I am truly touched at your tenderness and warm heart.
Let's talk of love and life.
I hope you will not mind if my wife joins the conversation as well.
There is more than enough love to go around, I think you agree.
Hugs and Kisses,
Mr.
Undisclosed Recipient
