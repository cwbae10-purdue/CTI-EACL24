Fears of business cybercrime have become a major concern for many companies around the world, and the UK is no exception.
A recent UK survey found security spending was on the rise at four out of ten firms.
The task is also increasingly time-consuming, with IT staff claiming to spend nearly one day a week dealing with security issues.
The survey of 100 CIOs at businesses in the UK found that four out of 10 had increased security spending a aimed at preventing business cybercrime in the past three years.
Of those, 55% had increased spending by more than a quarter.
The survey was conducted by IT recruiter Robert Half Technology.
Almost all – 97% – admitted that managing IT security was now “a challenge”.
The CIOs surveyed claimed to spend nearly a quarter of their time – 23% – managing security.
