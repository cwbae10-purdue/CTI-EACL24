A new update to the Apple Store app for iPhone and iPad has bolstered its security features, adding two-factor authentication (2FA) and increased Touch ID support, reports Slash Gear.
iOS users can now update the Apple Store app to version 3.3, which promises to make the device both more secure and more convenient.
Users can now view their orders, access EasyPay receipts, and make reservations at their local Apple Store as simply as scanning a fingerprint, doing away with the need to enter and re-enter their password.
The technology was first introduced to the lock screen of Apple devices, before being introduced to making purchases through the Apple Store.
Mac Rumors notes that the latest update also adds an option for 2FA, adding an extra layer of security to their digital orders through the Apple Store.
This function isn’t turned on by default, but users can take advantage of 2FA by turning it on via the My Apple ID webpage.
Once turned on, users will need to enter a four-digit verification code alongside their password which is sent to a trusted device – a small inconvenience, but one that will make the store a lot safer.
It’s thought that Apple may have introduced 2FA now following the release of the Apple Watch, although Apple Insider states that watch owners are not required to use Touch ID from a paired phone to view their recent order history.
While these latest changes will go some way to making the Apple Store more secure, it’s still important to be careful of which apps you download.
