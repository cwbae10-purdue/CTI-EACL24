Some of us are currently busily preparing for the AMTSO workshop in Helsinki on the 24th and 25th May 2010, just before the CARO workshop on 26th and 27th May (for which registration closes on 12th May).
Before the Helsinki events, though, the EICAR conference in Paris includes some interesting testing-related material before and during the main conference.

Among the presenters will be PIerre-Marc Bureau, Ján Vrabec and myself.
Pierre-Marc and I, along with Andrew Lee, will be presenting on Apple security issues (which will take a longer presentation than some Mac evangelists would like you to believe), while Ján and I are presenting a paper on performance testing (which will also be a hot topic at AMTSO, where a guidelines document on performance testing is likely to be voted on).
