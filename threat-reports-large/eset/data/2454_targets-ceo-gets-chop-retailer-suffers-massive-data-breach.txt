US retail giant Target has announced that it is parting ways with Gregg Steinhafel, its chairman, president and CEO.
If you work in an IT department, and think that your board isn’t taking information security seriously enough, then perhaps reminding your executive team about just how badly Target has been affected by its data breach will help focus their minds.
This morning US retail giant Target announced that it was parting ways with Gregg Steinhafel, its chairman, president and CEO.
It is less than five months since Target revealed that it had suffered a devastating data breach, which saw the personal information of up to 70 million customers’ stolen, and 40 million credit card details exposed.
In the wake of the massive security breach, customer trust in shopping at the store was hit, and the company’s sales, profit and stock price all suffered.
