Two-factor authentication (2FA) is to be added to the PlayStation Network, offering members even greater security.
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is to be added to the PlayStation Network, offering members even greater security.
News of this was first made public on Twitter on April 19th, when one of its users posted a tweet.
Sharing an image, he stated: “More proof about #PSN 2-step verification.
This is from PS3 after today’s v4.80 update.”
The image was a screenshot, which read: “The sign-in ID or password is not correct.
If 2-step verification is active, you must enter a device setup password into the [Password] field.
“Check your mobile phone for a text message about your Sony Entertainment Network account.”
2FA is often described as being an additional security process, which requires individuals to provide a supplementary piece of information when trying to access a device or account.
It usually comes in the form of a code, meaning that if you are signing into your email account on a new device for the first time, along with your username and password, you will have to input a uniquely generated code (usually sent to your smartphone).
Although Sony has yet to release an official statement, a representative told GameSpot that 2FA is going to be a permanent feature.
This is welcome news, further bolstering the security on the network, which was attacked two years ago.
A distributed denial of service attack resulted in the network being taken offline.
Sony commented at the time that no data had been accessed.
