Consumers have placed a high level of trust in healthcare organizations to keep their digital data safe, but companies cannot afford to take such good relationships for granted.
That is the main finding of a new report from Accenture, which found that 84% of consumers trust their physicians or healthcare providers to keep data secure, with a further 30% expressing a “great deal” of trust.
A similarly high percentage (80%) trust the labs processing medical tests to keep information secure, along with hospitals (79%) and pharmacies (77%)
However, another 13% have experienced a breach of their healthcare data, with over half (56%) becoming the victims of medical identity theft.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study found that 94% took action to protect their data, whether through changing passwords (22%), signing up to an identity protection service (22%), or by installing security software to their own computers (19%).
A further 13% went as far as actually switching their healthcare provider, while others sought legal advice (27%) or went to the police (18%).
As a result, Accenture says firms cannot afford to be complacent, stating: “Now is the time for healthcare providers, health plans and other organizations to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities, improve their defences, build resilience and better manage breaches.”
The evidence already suggests that a breach can prove costly.
While 68% of customers said their providers had handled breaches correctly, some 35% said they had nevertheless lost trust in their ability to secure data.
