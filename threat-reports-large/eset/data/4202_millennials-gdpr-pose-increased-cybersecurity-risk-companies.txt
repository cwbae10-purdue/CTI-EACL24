Millennials and the demands of upcoming GDPR regulations could result in a greater cybersecurity risk for many businesses, new research has suggested.
Businesses need to better prepare their data security systems in order to deal with the digital habits of millennials and the measures outlined by the upcoming GDPR regulations.
This is according a new survey released by the Ponemon Institute in conjunction with Citrix, which canvassed the opinions of over 4,000 IT, security and enterprise professionals.
Over half (55%) of respondents said millennials currently pose the greatest risk of “circumventing” IT security policies, while a further 39% said they were also more likely to use unauthorized apps in the workplace.
However, the survey findings suggest that different generations have their own issues when it comes to data security.
For example, 33% of survey respondents claimed that Baby Boomers (those born between 1946-1964) were more likely to fall victim to phishing and social engineering scams.
Another 30% said the same group displayed a lack of knowledge in how best to protect sensitive and confidential information.
Generation Xers (those born between 1965-1980) were also found to have weaknesses, with 32% of respondents stating they were the most likely to use unapproved apps and devices in the workplace.
While companies will need to take action to try and address these inter-generational issues, those dealing with organizations in the European Union are also facing the prospect of dealing with the upcoming GDPR regulation, which is set to be introduced in May 2018.
According to the survey, 74% of professionals believe the new rules will have a negative impact on business operations, while another 65% are concerned about the harsher penalties that will be introduced for non-compliance.
