“Infrastructure Attacks: The Next Generation?” now includes the speaker notes, which hopefully makes it more interesting and useful.
Earlier this year I delivered a presentation at Infosec Europe on SCADA issues, a topic that's come up a lot in my articles here.
There isn't a paper to go with that presentation, but the barebones slide deck on the ESET white papers page has now been replaced with a version – Infrastructure Attacks: The Next Generation?
– that includes the speaker notes, which hopefully makes it more interesting and useful.
