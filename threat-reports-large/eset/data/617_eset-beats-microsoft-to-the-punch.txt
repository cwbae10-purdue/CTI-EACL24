I recently got a new MacBook Pro and set up Windows 7 and ESET Smart Security on it.
This morning when I started the computer ESET Smart Security notified me that my operating system wasn’t up to date.
This was a bit of a surprise because I updated everything when I installed the operating system.

It turns out that ESET Smart Security detected that Windows Defender’s definitions were out of date before Windows even knew about it!
Was it a simple timing fluke?
I’ll have to wait and see if that happens more often.
