As I previously blogged today, the hacker who broke into Sarah Palin’s Yahoo account was convicted on two charges.
The way that David Kernall gained access to Palin’s email account was by trying to log into her account, saying “I forgot my password” and then he correctly answered the password reset questions.
Some of the questions had answer’s that were public information and others were easily guessed.
When you have to choose a password reset question, always use the wrong answer.
There is typically only one correct answer to the questions and often times the answer is known by others.
There are an infinite number of wrong answers so it is extremely difficult for an attacker to correctly answer the rest questions if you use the wrong answer.
Now, here’s the tricky part… How do YOU remember the wrong answers?
You can write them down.
You can use tricks such as a theme.
For example, if you like Star Wars, then perhaps your first car was the Millennium Falcon.
You first pet was a wookie.
For me, I use the comment field in Password Corral.
