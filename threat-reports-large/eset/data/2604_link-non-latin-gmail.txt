The human brain is a funny old thing, and remarkably smart.
But sometimes it’s too smart for its own good.
Take, for instance, the infamous “Face on Mars” photographed by the Viking 1 Orbiter in 1976, which lead to rampant speculation and excitable headlines in the media that it must be evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life.
But was it really an ancient giant statue left by former inhabitants of the Red Planet?
Or was it, in reality, evidence that humans are hardwired to seeing human faces, based upon minimal data, and are prone to seeing faces – in clouds, on the moon, on the surface of Mars – where none really exists?
Scientists call this psychological phenomenon pareidolia.
Observations by other spacecraft visiting the Cydonia region of Mars in the decades since have revealed that there is no giant face carved into the rock.
Our eyes decided us, and we saw what we wanted to see.
And, perhaps surprisingly, this is relevant to computer security.
