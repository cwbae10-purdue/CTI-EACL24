Apple customers are prime targets for cyberattacks as they are more likely to have a high disposable income, a security expert has suggested.
WeLiveSecurity contributor Graham Cluley has warned owners of Apple devices to be on their guard after spotting a fresh SMS phishing scam designed to compromise Apple ID credentials.
The scam in question came in the form of text messages from “Appleinc” warning recipients that their Apple IDs were about to expire.
Victims are urged to click links to hold on to their IDs, which direct them to a replica version of the Apple website where they’re asked to hand over their credentials.
After harvesting Apple ID usernames and passwords, the website then asks victims to provide further personal information to “unlock” their accounts – including their telephone numbers, address and credit card details.
“They deliberately took advantage of people’s trust in the Apple brand to steal information,” Mr. Cluley told the BBC.
“The truth is that criminals will go where the money is.
Apple products cost more than some of their competitors so it’s likely that their customers have more disposable income.
“That’s cash, which the bad guys would like to have filling their pockets,” he added.
Apple’s support website warns customers never to enter their Apple ID information on a non-Apple website.
However, with a convincing replica site, it can be difficult to spot the difference.
As well as the name of the text message sender “Appleinc”, the International Business Times noted that the URL victims were directed to – “isappleexpired.co.uk” – was another giveaway in this instance.
