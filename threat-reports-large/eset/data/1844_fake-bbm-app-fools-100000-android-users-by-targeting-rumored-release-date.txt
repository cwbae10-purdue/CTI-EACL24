Cybercriminals cashed in on an internet rumor to fool 100,000 Android users into downloading a fake BlackBerry Messenger app for Android.
Cybercriminals cashed in on an internet rumor to fool 100,000 Android users into downloading a fake BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) app for Android.
The fake BBM app – masquerading as an eagerly awaited download, and released to coincide with a rumored release date – instead delivered adware.
The app had been downloaded 100,000 times before Google removed it from Play Store, according to a report by CNET.
BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) is a popular messaging system and “mobile social network” currently bundled with BlackBerry’s operating system – but the company announced in May this year that the software would launch on iOS and Android.
Persistent internet rumor suggested that the product was to launch on June 27 – so scammers launched the fake BBM app called “BlackBerry Messenger BBM” last week, with the developer name listed as RIM.
Research in Motion was a previous name for BlackBerry.
