Facecrooks has flagged a scam that has apparently already tricked 300,000 people into Liking a scam page.
I tend not to try to compete with sites like Facecrooks that specialize in tracking malware issues: however, they've just flagged a scam that has apparently already tricked around 300,000 Facebook users into Liking a scam page, and are appealing for people to report it to Facebook in the hope of getting the scam site taken down.
Of course, it's up to you whether you actually report it, but it's evidently a bad idea to click on links in messages along the lines of this one:
wooow now I have seen how many hours I spend on Facebook…to find your time click here >
Evidently a far more effective hook than I'd have thought,…
According to the detailed Facecrooks description, the link leads to a malicious Facebook page that exposes you to several rogue Facebook apps and Profile Peeker scams.
Going along with it will not only result in your friends being spammed with scam messages, but expose your FB data to other misuse.
