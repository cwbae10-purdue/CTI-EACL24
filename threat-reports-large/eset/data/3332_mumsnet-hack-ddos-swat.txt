And the damage doesn’t end there…
Mumsnet, the phenomenally popular British parenting website, has suffered an attack from hackers which has seen users’ accounts breached, and passwords stolen.
In addition, online criminals have launched a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the site, and targeted co-founder Justine Roberts with a ‘swatting’ attack that saw an armed police unit being called to her home.
According to a post on the Mumsnet website, the problems started on August 11, when the site was bombarded with internet traffic, making it difficult for legitimate users to reach it.
Access to the site was restored by the following morning, but a group calling itself DadSecurity claimed responsibility on Twitter for the denial-of-service and threatened further attacks.
