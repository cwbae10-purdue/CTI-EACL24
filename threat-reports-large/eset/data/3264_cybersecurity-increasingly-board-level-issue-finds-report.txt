“The primary reasons for establishing this reporting line outside of IT are to improve separation between execution and oversight, to increase the corporate profile of the information security function and to break the mindset among employees and stakeholders that security is an IT problem,” said Tom Scholtz, vice president and Gartner Fellow told told hotforsecurity.com.
The overall trend seems to indicate that increasingly senior levels are supporting security programmes, with 63% of respondents telling Gartner that they receive sponssorship from outside the IT team, up considerably from 54% in 2014.
