Quite a while ago I posted a blog titled “The Spirit of Cooperation” in which I spoke of the AVAR conference.
Today I write from the Virus Bulletin conference.
It could be my last blog if my boss finds out I’m writing a blog while he’s addressing us in a session at the conference :)

These conferences bring together researchers from many companies and countries.
Competition is left to marketing and presentations as well as discussions about the issues and problems we all face are the norm.
Each time we get together we meet new people, and find new ways to work together.
With all the recent hype around whitelisting and the “death of antivirus” it is quite amusing to look around at all the bright people working together to help make the Internet a safer place.
Either the premise that “antivirus is dead” is dead wrong, or zombies are some of the best people in the world.
