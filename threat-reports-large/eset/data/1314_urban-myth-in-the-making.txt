…you can probably guess what I think about the idea of an undetectable virus…
I picked up a post today at bleepingcomputer.com about the “botnet 4.0 undetectable virus“, Well, you can probably guess what I think about the idea of an undetectable virus, and if not (and you actually care what I think about anything!)
you can check out my blog Undetectable Virus Plays a Cool Hand.
(Clue: the Chainmailcheck blog specializes in hoaxes (intentional and unintentional), semi-hoaxes, scams, spams and uncle Tom Cobblers and all.)
In this case, the name of the virus suggests a possible misunderstanding related to the TDL4 botnet.
