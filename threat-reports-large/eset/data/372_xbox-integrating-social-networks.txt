Just a few short days ago I read the announcement that Microsoft announced a new relationship with the social networking services Twitter and Facebook.

The Xbox Live team has a page that lays out some of the best ways to protect your account: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/accountsecurity.htm
Beware of phishes (fake emails asking for credentials) – quite simply, you won’t receive email from a legitimate source asking for your credentials
Even when in IM/chat sessions, beware of links that are posted – especially when they are unsolicited.
Many links to malicious sites today can “push” malware on a PC without even asking the user to download and install it.
Watch where you browse!
Use proactive anti-malware (anti-virus) software.
