A school entirely focussed on teaching cybersecurity skills has launched in the UK, reports Computer Business Review.
The Global Institute of Cyber, Intelligence & Security is opening in London, and will offer short courses covering areas such as cyber resilience, security, military, policing, counter terrorism and financial crime, according to IT Pro Portal.
The school says that the courses are being pitched towards professionals looking to expand their knowledge in key areas of cybersecurity, but may also be of interest to those from other disciplines who would benefit from a greater understanding of modern security issues.
Speaking to Computer Weekly, GCIS’s academic director Martin Wright said, “The cyber school aims to provide a better understanding of issues and solutions surrounding the nature of crime, cyber insecurity and terrorism.”
“At a time when international cybersecurity is being continuously tested, we are eager to launch our expert training school in order to up-skill and train people in the industry,” he added.
Speaking at the school’s launch, HP Enterprise chief information security officer Andrea Simmons welcomed the opening, explaining that education is key in the fight against cybercrime: “Security is everyone’s responsibility – it is not just down to IT, and it should be a part of everyone’s day job.
