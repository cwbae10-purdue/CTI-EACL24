An updated version of the paper “Ten Ways to Dodge CyberBullets”, addressing the question “what are the top 10 things that people can do to protect themselves against malicious activity?”
Back in 2008 ESET's global research teams put together some suggestions for "a top ten of things that people can do to protect themselves against malicious activity."
That series of blogs was subsequently expanded into a paper called "Ten Ways to Dodge CyberBullets", addressing the question "what are the top 10 things that people can do to protect themselves against malicious activity?"
Earlier this year, I was asked to update that paper to reflect the changes in the threat landscape since I originally put it together.
The refreshed document is now available on the ESET white papers page under the title Ten Ways to Dodge CyberBullets: Reloaded.
I anticipate that it will soon be going great guns.

This might be a good moment to remind you that there are plenty of other resources related to safety online and what we used to call "safe hex" put together by ESET and its partners at Securing Our eCity.
