Queen Elizabeth has been consulting one of the United Kingdom’s most prominent cybersecurity experts, leading to speculation the Royal Family may be seeking protection from hackers and spies, reports the Independent Online.
The British monarch was said to have met Professor Sadie Creese – an expert in cybersecurity from the University of Oxford – over a palace luncheon.
Speaking to The Daily Mail, a palace courtier said, “Her Majesty likes to keep abreast of the latest developments in technology and the problems they can also bring.”
“Professor Creese is eminent in her field and was able to share some of her knowledge with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh,” they added.
The news follows a story that Prince William paid a visit to GCHQ – Britain’s spy agency – and Morning News USA reports that the visit followed up on hacking attempts on various members of the royal family, including Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, Prince Harry and Prince William himself.
The report goes on to claim that the royals were given specific advice to change their email addresses, and to reduce their social media presence to limit the chances of a successful attack.
A spokesman from Buckingham Palace confirmed the visit from Professor Creese, but declined to add any explanation telling the Daily Mail, “We don’t make any comment on security for the Royal Family.”
