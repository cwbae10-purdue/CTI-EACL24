Perhaps I imagined it, but a few days ago when I allowed Firefox to update to fix security vulnerabilities my privacy settings were reset to less private settings.
I had Firefox set to clear the history on exit, and prompt me.
I also had it set not to accept third party cookies.
After the upgrade
Perhaps I imagined it, but a few days ago when I allowed Firefox to update to fix security vulnerabilities my privacy settings were reset to less private settings.
I had Firefox set to clear the history on exit, and prompt me.
I also had it set not to accept third party cookies.
After the upgrade the settings were rest to defaults.
I simply happened to notice that I wasnâ€™t prompted when I closed Firefox.
A day or so later another update for Firefox and the privacy options were reset to the defaults.
This is not a behavior that should be happening.
Perhaps my computer is an anomaly and there is a conflict.
Is anyone else seeing this behavior?
