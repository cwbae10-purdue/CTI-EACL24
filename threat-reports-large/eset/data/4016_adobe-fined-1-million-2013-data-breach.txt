The financial repercussions of a data breach have been highlighted by the $1 million fine handed out to Adobe Systems for a 2013 security incident.
Roy Cooper, attorney general of North Carolina, said that businesses and government “must do more” to protect sensitive data from getting into the hands of cybercriminals.
The 2013 data breach is thought to have affected close to half a million consumers, and the severity of the fine is intended to send a strong message – keep data secure or face consequences.
Accordingly, as demonstrated with Adobe Systems, serious financial penalties will be handed out to those who fail to put in place adequate measures.
All of the affected US states concluded that the company not only failed here but elsewhere too.
It also lacked the ability to “immediately detect an attack”, they determined.
“Under a multistate agreement announced today, Adobe will pay $1 million to North Carolina and 14 other states and implement new policies and practices to prevent future similar breaches,” a North Carolina Department of Justice press release revealed.
“The settlement resolves an investigation into the 2013 data breach of certain Adobe servers, including servers containing the personal information of approximately 552,000 residents of the participating states.”
“Consumers who entrust a company with their personal data should have that trust respected,” Maura Healey, attorney general of Massachusetts was quoted by Newton Patch as saying.
“Adobe put consumers’ personal data at risk of being compromised by a data breach, and that is unacceptable.
