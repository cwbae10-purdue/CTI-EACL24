Although it’s far from always possible to determine the perpetrators of a denial-of-service attack and bring them to justice, there are plenty of people who have been put behind bars because of this modern-day crime.
He isn’t the first and he certainly won’t be the last.
A British man has been given an eight month prison sentence after being found guilty of knocking more than 300 websites offline with denial-of-service attacks.
51-year-old Ian Sullivan from Merseyside attacked a wide range of websites in 2013, including ones belonging to British Airways, the Conservative Party, multinational banks and Merseyside Police.
In addition, Sullivan’s denial-of-service attacks targeted adoption, children’s social services, and social housing websites – leaving thousands of people unable to access vital information and support, after rendering the sites completely inaccessible by flooding them with traffic.
Jobless Sullivan, a father of six, was apprehended in July 2013 after a joint operation between the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Crime Unit and the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit.
Police had linked a Twitter handle (@anonian01) referencing the DDoS attacks to the attacks themselves.
