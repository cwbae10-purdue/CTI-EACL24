A carder like tool for cybercriminals that promises to use stolen credit card details in a more ‘human way’ to bypass fraud detection has been found on sale for as little as $180, according to The Register.
“Voxis Platform” is described as “advanced cash out software”, which will help cybercriminals earn “astronomical amounts” by mimicking human behavior on different payment gateways.
The advert, found posted to many underground forums, offered the tool for just $180.
The software claims to work by automatically making fake purchases on compromised cards, and takes out the laborious human involvement by making them look believably human in order to beat fraud detection systems.
Andrew Komarov who discovered the software advertised, explained to Network World that Voxis platform relieves cybercriminals from “laboriously entering credit card data into fake ecommerce websites.
The actors upload a batch of stolen credit card data into Voxis that then submits fraudulent card transactions with the characteristics of a human sending a payment from a mobile device or PC.”
He explained that if a data breach goes undetected and the credit card numbers are not canceled, stolen cards could be used for between two and three weeks.
SC Magazine reports that Voxis Platform works with “32 payment gateways, including PayPal.”
With the recent well publicized attacks on Target, Home Depot, Dairy Queen, Kmart and Staples, cybercriminals will be in a ‘race against time’ to use the stolen credit card data before the cards are cancelled and lose their value, so this kind of software certainly has its appeal.
