Around 13% of employees boast that they still have full access to the systems of their previous employers, Help Net Security reports.
Many others have access to two or three.
Of those who had acesss to one previous employer, 16% of those polled said that they could access the systems of everyone they had ever worked for.
The survey was conducted at a recent IT conference, and 270 current IT workers answered the questionnaire.
Workers who still had access to one previous employer didn’t stop there, the survey found.
Of those who had access to one previous employer’s systems, nearly a quarter could still access their last two employers, and 16% said they could access the network of every company they ever worked for.
Shockingly, while 84% of companies had strict policies on allowing contractors permanent access to networks, 16% did not, the report said.

“Organizations must implement a policy where privileged account passwords are automatically updated on a frequent basis, with unique and complex values.
