A new e-learning tool has been launched in the UK to help HR professionals effectively deal with cybersecurity issues in the British workplace.
The launch was marked by an event attended by Ed Vaizey, minister for Culture and the Digital Economy, alongside the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the professional body for HR in the UK.
The course is free to use and highlights the critical role that HR departments have to play in helping eliminate security risks in organizations.
Last year, government statistics revealed that online security breaches can cost large businesses up to $2.1 million and as much as $450,000 for smaller companies.
Research also reveals that most of these breaches are related to employees not being aware of potential risks, as well as a lack of compliance to organizational policies.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Vaizey said: “HR professionals handle sensitive personal data so it’s crucial they are able to protect this properly.
“The new e-learning module we’re launching with the CIPD will help the HR profession tackle cyber threats and help keep our businesses safe in our cyberspace.”
The overarching aim is to help HR professionals across the UK protect both themselves and sensitive HR data, as well as help educate their staff as to how a culture of care can protect the business as a whole.
Peter Cheese, CIPD chief executive, added: “Risk is fundamentally down to how people make decisions and judgments and, while most people won’t do this with malicious intent, businesses can still be left exposed.”
