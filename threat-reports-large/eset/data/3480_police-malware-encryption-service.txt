British police arrested a man and a woman earlier this week, suspected of operating a website which offered services to online criminals which could help them evade detection by anti-virus software.
The couple, both aged 22, were arrested in Colchester, Essex, are alleged to have run the reFUD.me website, used by malware authors to encrypt their creations, rewriting malicious code so it is no longer easily detected by anti-virus products.
In this instance, “FUD” does not stand for “Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt” but “Fully UnDetectable”.
The site wasn’t being run philanthropically by its owner, who went by the handle of ‘Killamuvz’.
Instead, those wishing to encrypt their malware were charged $20 per month (or $90 for lifetime usage) for a license to use the Cryptex encryption service according to a statement issued by the National Crime Agency’s National Cyber Crime Unit.
In addition, the site offered to scan malicious programs against a wide array of anti-virus products, helping criminals determine that as few security products as possible were capable of detecting their malware – increasing the chances of successful infection.
According to statistics displayed on the reFUD.me website, there have been more than 1.2 million scans via the site since February 2015.
Of course, there are legitimate services available (VirusTotal is probably the most well known) which also offer to scan files against a large number of anti-virus products, but the key difference is that reFUD.me promised it would not share uploaded files with the security community.
And the promised privacy offered to malware authors is what has made the service popular with the dark side of the web.
