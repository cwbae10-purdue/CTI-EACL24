My colleague Aleks Matrosov has come across an interesting if uncomfortable post on a Russian language forum, advertising a "Boot loader for drivers" currently under test that doesn't require a Digital Signature driver, which sounds very much like our old friend TDL4.
This metamorphic malware (each build generates a fresh binary) loads before the start of PatchGuard.
It's claimed to support all versions of Microsoft Windows, since XP including Windows 7 sp1, inclusive, and supports both x86 and AMD64 (EM64T).
A mere $9000, which I guess gives you some idea of how much profit there is in this kind of "costly but effective" malcode.
