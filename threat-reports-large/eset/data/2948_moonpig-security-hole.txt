Moonpig, the online personalised card company, has been accused of a shockingly sloppy attitude to security, after apparently leaving a serious hole in its security unpatched.
Moonpig, the online personalised card company, has been accused of a shockingly sloppy attitude to security, after apparently leaving a serious hole in its security unpatched.
The vulnerability, which was said to have been first reported to Moonpig back in August 2013 (yes, 2013) allows anyone with a modicum of programming knowledge to access the names, dates of birth, email and home addresses of the company’s 3.6 million customers.
All that it takes is to change the Customer ID number sent in an API request.
No authentication is required.
Developer Paul Price discovered the serious security hole back in August 2013 (yes, 2013) and told Moonpig about the problem.
Frustrated by the company’s lack of response after some 17 months, Price has now gone public.
In Price’s tests he discovered that the API calls were not rate-limited, meaning that in theory it appears it would be possible to work your way through every variation of the Customer ID and eventually access the personal details for all of Moonpig’s users.
News of the flaw quickly spread on Twitter last night to such an extent that “Moonpig” was trending in London.
If you have an account with Moonpig you should probably assume that any details in that account are now public!

Sadly Moonpig’s UK branch appeared to be oblivious to furore, telling followers it had settled down with a nice cup of tea to watch the latest series of David Tennant detective drama “Broadchurch”:
It's finally back on our screens, tea in hand, phone on silent, ready to be gripped once again.
