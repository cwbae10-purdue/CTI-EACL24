OK, if some unimaginative journalist and/or editor can call a pair of bulging briefs “Weinergate” I can call this Twitter App “FireTweet”.

Despite allegedly being unable to read private messages, applications on Twitter can be made to read your private messages without your consent.

When you sign in and authorize the application it does indeed access your direct messages.
Twitter responded to the problem and clarified that currently apps can access your direct messages.
At the end of June there will be changes designed to give users more control over privacy.
The web messages are there for the new technology, but it hasn’t been implemented yet.
Until June 30th Twitter apps can access your private messages.
