A US government probe into claims that certain heart implants are vulnerable to hacking attacks, has resulted in emergency security patches being issued for devices that cardiac patients have in their homes.
A US government probe into claims that certain heart implants are vulnerable to hacking attacks, has resulted in emergency security patches being issued for devices that cardiac patients have in their homes.
The medical devices under the microscope come from St Jude Medical, recently acquired by Abbott Laboratories, who were informed by researchers last year that their devices could be forced to malfunction by administering a mild electric shock, pacing at a potentially dangerous rate, or tricked into suffering a high-risk battery drain.
Controversially, research company MedSec Holdings and hedge fund Muddy Waters reportedly profited by short selling stock in St Jude Medical, before telling the manufacturer about the serious vulnerabilities.
The St Jude Medical Merlin@home Transmitter connects the tiny computer inside a patient’s implanted cardiac pacemaker to a doctor’s surgery or clinic, using a telephone line, internet connection or 3G cellular network to communicate critical information about a patient’s heart activity.
The good news for patients is that they don’t have to make as many trips to the clinic, and don’t have to see their doctor in person so often.
Remote monitoring allows a doctor to both monitor how a heart is behaving, and see if the implanted device is behaving unusually.
From this point of view, the technological advance can be seen as a good thing.
But there is a genuine concern – as we have described before – that the rush to embrace technology to improve and save patients’ lives could introduce high-tech risks.
