The growth of the botnet is troubling because it is completely preventable and because it means the infected computers are vulnerable to other threats and that these users are not using security software that is current.

Disabling autorun is a good security precaution.

Conficker spreads by exploiting a vulnerability in Windows, except if you patch like you should.
Evidently many corporate IT people failed to learn the lessons of CodeRed, Nimda, Slammer, Sasser, BubbleBoy, and a host of other threats from days gone by that were preventable just by applying security patches.
Conficker also spreads through share folders on networks.
People need to use strong passwords and protect network shares.
