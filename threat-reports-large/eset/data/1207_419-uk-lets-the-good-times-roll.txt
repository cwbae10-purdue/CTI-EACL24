According to my colleague Urban Schrott, the UK is awash with so much money that the Prime Minister is mailing Irish citizens to tell them that their Overdue Inheritance payment of £2.5 million is waiting for them.
The British Prime Minister, that is.
For the geographically and/or politically challenged, the Republic of Ireland hasn't been part of the UK since 1922, though Northern Island still is.
But perhaps Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Éire, was busy that day.

We citizens of the UK clearly have more than enough already.

Probably not Diego Garcia, though.

And perhaps a little more.
And perhaps a little more…
