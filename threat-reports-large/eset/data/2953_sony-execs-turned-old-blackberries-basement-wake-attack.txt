Sony executives turned to old BlackBerries found in a basement in the firm’s California headquarters in, using SMS text messages and a ‘phone tree’ to communicate in the wake of the attack.
Executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment turned to old-school security measures in a last-ditch attempt to keep corporate data private – digging out corporate BlackBerries found in a basement in California, Mashable reports.
Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Entertainment switched to a ‘phone tree’ system where information was relayed person-to-person via mobile devices and private Gmail accounts rather than corporate ones.
Key to this was a stash of old, unused BlackBerry devices, according to the New York Times‘ report – which were used, Mashable said, because emails sent via the devices travelled via BlackBerry’s servers rather than Sony’s.
Staff also communicated via text message over the course of weeks in which the extent of the attack became clear – and the company rapidly adapted to working without voice mail, corporate email or digital production systems.
Technical staff debated whether to take the company entirely offline.
The extent of the attack was entirely unknown in the days afterwards: the company’s first press release simply stated that the company faced ‘IT issues.’
