So, back in harness.
I’ve been away for a couple of weeks: not on holiday as such, though I did take some days out, but concentrating on writing: it didn’t hurt that I didn’t have a full-strength internet connection to distract me, though.
Before I left, I was interviewed by a Turkish security site.
It was an interesting experience in that when I get interviewed by the press it’s usually about something fairly specific, whereas this was more of an “opinion piece”.
Anyway, I assumed that most of you probably wouldn’t want to go and read it in Turkish, but some of you might find it interesting in English.
Well, maybe not.
There were only half a dozen questions, but my answers were uncharacteristically verbose, so I’ll split them across a couple of blogs.
Question (1): Are we afraid of surfing on the Internet?
I don’t know, but we probably should be.
I wouldn’t really want to see everyone so terrified of the hackers and bogeymen that they won’t make use of all the possibilities for business and social networking that the Internet offers, but we should at least have a healthy respect for the risks that Internet browsing entails.
