Facebook has made a new feature called Security Checkup generally available after testing on an invite-only group, according to SoftPedia.
Coming soon to a news feed on your desktop, the feature will display as a “Stay Secure on Facebook” notification, which users can choose to dismiss or interact with.
The Checkup tool is designed to help non-technical users through the process of making their account more secure, and breaks down functions previously hidden deep in settings and options from the classic Settings -> Security page into three simple steps.
In a blog post, Facebook said: “We want everyone to have a safe experience on Facebook.
That’s why we have dedicated teams and intelligent security systems working around the clock to help keep your account secure.
Starting today, you can try a new tool called Security Checkup that makes it easier to find and use the security controls for your account.”
The three main sections prompt the user to log out any unused apps or computers, turn on login alerts for unauthorised devices or browsers, and also quickly change the account’s password.
