Reports from Asia say that Singapore is to open a new Cyber Security Lab in a bid to combat criminal hacking by training law enforcement officers in the latest anti-cyber crime techniques.
The announcement came during a session in the Singapore parliament last Friday (8 March) according to ZD NET Asia.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Teo Chee Hean, said that the new facility would be up and running by 2014 and set up in partnership with the Singapore IT Security Authority (SITSA).
According to the Philipine Star, the deputy prime minister said that Singapore was particularly at risk from cyber attacks because of what he described as its advanced, highly networked government.
