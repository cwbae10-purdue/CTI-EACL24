Close to half all businesses in the UK are of the opinion that they are safe from cybercrime, according to new research.
They believe the risks are minute.
Close to half (44%) of all businesses in the UK are of the opinion that they are safe from cybercrime, according to new research.
Aviva’s SME Pulse survey found that two in every five businesses consider the risk to be very small.
This is despite the fact that over a third of business owners admit to being a victim of cybercrime (including phishing and pharming).
The research also worryingly revealed that only a quarter of businesses are actually taking steps to protect themselves from a cyberattack.
“Protecting your business from cybercrime is good business because your customers want the reassurance that their data is safe in your hands,” said Angus Eaton, managing director of commercial lines at Aviva.
“If you haven’t done so already now is the time to put cyber risk on your agenda and take action to help prevent your business becoming a target.”
It was also found that some businesses wouldn’t even know what to do in the case of a cyberattack.
Over a third admitted that they would be at a complete loss if they fell victim to cybercrime, while more than a quarter said they are unsure about how to secure themselves against such threats.
Aviva has come up with some recommendations for businesses that feel that they need to boost their knowledge in this area.
One of the tips is to put in place an efficient security process, which promotes “safe computing in the workplace”.
This could include something as simple as not opening suspect emails or attachments, which could contain viruses.
