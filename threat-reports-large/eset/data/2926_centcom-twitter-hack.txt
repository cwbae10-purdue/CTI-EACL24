Twitter and YouTube accounts run by the US military’s Central Command are hijacked by hackers claiming to back Islamic State.
Guess who hasn’t been using two factor authentication to protect its social media accounts?
Twitter and YouTube accounts belonging to Central Command – the group responsible for United States’ military operations in the Middle East – were hijacked yesterday by hackers claiming to back Islamic State.
In a series of messages posted on the @CENTCOM Twitter account , the pro-ISIS hackers claimed to have broken into US military networks and stolen information.
For some time, anyone on Twitter could read bizarre messages on the @CENTCOM account including “I love you ISIS”.
It’s bad enough having your social media accounts compromised, of course, but then the hackers began to post what they claimed were leaked military documents.
And it wasn’t just Central Command’s Twitter account that was being abused.
Its YouTube channel had also been broken into, with the hackers uploading videos and changing images:
In less than an hour, Twitter had suspended the compromised account.
