As Facebook continues to attract more pages and videos containing malware, we welcome your help in blocking these.
If you discover a page or video, where you knowingly did not click the “Like” button, and it shows you as a “Like”, report it to us.
Send us an email to samples@eset.com with the subject “Auto-like Mail” with the corresponding URL link.
All such links will be reviewed and blocked if threats or malicious content is confirmed.
