ESET researchers uncover a new campaign of the Winnti Group targeting universities and using ShadowPad and Winnti malware
In November 2019, we discovered a new campaign run by the Winnti Group against two Hong Kong universities.
We found a new variant of the ShadowPad backdoor, the groupâ€™s flagship backdoor, deployed using a new launcher and embedding numerous modules.
The Winnti malware was also found at these universities a few weeks prior to ShadowPad.
The Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the video game and software industries leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple video games) that is then used to compromise more victims.
It is also known for having compromised various targets in the healthcare and education sectors.
ESET researchers recently published a white paper updating our understanding of the arsenal of the Winnti Group, following a blog post documenting a supply-chain attack targeting the videogame industry in Asia.
