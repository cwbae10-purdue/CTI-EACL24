This is part two of a recent email interview with a Turkish web site, with part one made available here for the benefit of those of us who don’t speak Turkish.
I’ve done a little editing on parts one and two, primarily for cosmetic reasons.
Question (4): What the golden rules for using the Internet with peace of mind?
If I find any such golden rules, I’ll let you know.
:)
If there is one golden rule, it’s “Don’t take anything you’re told for granted.” There are plenty of people out there – hackers, crackers, scammers, spammers, phishers, 419-ers, botherders, hoaxers – who have no compunction about lying to you in order to get your money, your identity, your World of Warcraft avatar, or just to prove to themselves that they’re cleverer than you are.
There are others who have something to sell to you – a product, a service, a web site, subscription to a magazine, a blog – who may not intend to mislead you, but don’t know enough not to mislead you.
This, of course, begs the question “so how do you know whose advice to trust?” which I suppose takes us back to that list of resources I need to update.
Even then, of course, you might not want to take my word for what defines a good resource.
:)
Question (5): What are the main reasons there is so much more cybercrime than there was?How can we prevent these crimes?
There are some obvious answers to this question and at least one that isn’t so obvious.
Of course, I don’t guarantee that any of them are correct answers.
