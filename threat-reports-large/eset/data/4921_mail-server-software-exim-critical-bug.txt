If exploited, the security hole in Exim could allow attackers to run arbitrary commands on vulnerable mail servers
Exim, the popular mail transfer agent (MTA) software, contains a critical-rated vulnerability that can, in some scenarios, enable remote attackers to run commands of their choice on unpatched mail servers, researchers from Qualys have found.
Tracked under CVE-2019-10149, the remote command execution flaw impacts Exim installations 4.87 through 4.91.
The bug was fixed with the latest version (4.92) of the open-source software, albeit, by all accounts, unknowingly.
According to Qualys, the issue “was not identified as a security vulnerability” when the latest version was released in February.
The software, which is responsible for transferring messages from one computer to another is, installed on a large chunk of mail servers that are visible online.
More than 95 percent of them appear to run one of Exim’s older – and vulnerable – versions.
According to Qualys, the bug could enable attackers to execute commands on a vulnerable Exim server as the root user and effectively take it over.
The vulnerability is “trivially exploitable” by a local attacker, even with a low-privileged account.
Perhaps more worryingly, however, remote exploitation is also possible, both in Exim’s default and non-default setup.
The silver lining is that things would be more difficult for remote attackers.
“This vulnerability is exploitable instantly by a local attacker (and by a remote attacker in certain non-default configurations).
To remotely exploit this vulnerability in the default configuration, an attacker must keep a connection to the vulnerable server open for 7 days (by transmitting one byte every few minutes).
However, because of the extreme complexity of Exim’s code, we cannot guarantee that this exploitation method is unique; faster methods may exist”.
Additional details about how the hole in Exim could be exploited are available in the aforementioned advisory.
