For years, cyber criminals have organized their operations and traded resources through discussion forums and auction sites.
One popular item to trade is access to virus infected PCs for cash.
These trading schemes are often called pay-per install (PPI) programs.
We have recently started an investigation on a new type of pay-per install program, this time threatening Android devices.
We began our investigation by looking at domain names and malicious files related to what appears to be a Russian web forum used by the cyber criminals for marketing and supporting their PPI scheme.
The forum started operating at the end of 2011.
From the information we could gather, actors who successfully install malicious software on Android devices get paid between 2 and 5 US dollars per installation.
This is much higher than the typical price for Windows PCs.
As shown in the image below, taken from the front page of this web forum, the administrators of this program have even prepared graphics to attract as many crooks as possible.
The software that is installed on Android devices is usually in the Android/TrojanSMS malware family.
These malicious programs send SMS messages to premium rate numbers, bringing monetary profit to the malware operators.
Our colleagues at Quickheal have blogged about one of these applications.
Methods for infecting Android devices are varied but usually involve distributing malware as cracked or pirated copies of popular commercial games.
Phones or tablets then get infected when users search forums or alternative market places for popular games like Angry Birds, instant messaging clients, and so forth.
The following figure shows the download page for one such trojan being distributed as a game.
So far, we have found thirty different domain names related to this operation.
They have been used to distribute hundreds of malicious files.
During our analysis, we saw twenty-three unique variants being distributed through more than 300 unique URLs.
Most of the malicious samples we analyzed were pre-programmed to send SMSes to the following premium: 6666, 9999, 7375.
Here is a list of domain names which seem to be related to this operation: android-programmy.ru android-s.in android-syst.ru androidz-mix.ru apk-fail.ru cekc26.ru download-site.in faiil-apk.ru faiiles.ru fiileapk.ru file-m-obi.net file-mo-bi.net filemifree.net fileow68.net flash-mobile-dl.ru flashmobiledl.ru free-mobile.in herwekome.ru htcffile.ru htcfi1e.ru htcfile.ru inter4me.net mobile-s.in mobilgamesappsru.ru nokialists.ru operamlni.ru qertys1016.ru regimens.ru regimens.ru.in wwwmobiles.ru
The following file hashes are Android/TrojanSMS variants used in this operation: 18c86d12a7463a11836c581264b92893f840028f 1a840e11f615c251eff4c0f699258190a0496c60 1bd6556ebb463cff1d7afb5681e9e5886b636bab 3b5c5ae0131566c232ebf7a4f777b55e7ab53862 418258e490ecb1af13033193221b765f48492d42 50c2d3065ffdb6e4786fc8d4d73620da81af66c6 64efb1a181de3ffdb77b381cdf2185f74eb7cfe4 7196e9301282b74ed33ab565a07a31dee6f8243b 7444868a3f11597781583c368c22676c14259a64 74a90abf1915c6d0fe23e4cbe1cec2a53d759d03 8943d767e1d4f6fb3bfe28e64a417af2b00163cf 90771e904db0d30e4c2dc4efd625f8030d457aed 91c97cba1e545ac45a6f892ec20cbe440928ff50 955bf6367aa5629b5fa0f7fb6f54ebba8494f499 a49d56496662b03d4913af90865a59d0a40d61cf b73eef29993b3803dafef4c784fd87e774a8bc62 d80f10df01b0527cd0859f7ee4e575ea7b770964 e63870a7850e226e2baed964d23b1de1c56aae63
This discovery, while not ground breaking, illustrates a disturbing trend in malware creation.
