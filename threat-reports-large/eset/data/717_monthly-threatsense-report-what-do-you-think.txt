In March 2010 we changed the format of this document, as we found that some people thought it was just a list of the top ten threats, which hasn’t been the case for a long while.

In March 2010 we changed the format of this document, as we found that some people thought it was just a list of the top ten threats, which hasn’t been the case for a long while.
Of course, those data are still included, but we’ve moved them to the end of the document.
As you’ll see from the Table of Contents when the April report comes out, it includes one or two further changes to the format and, more importantly, the content of the document.
We'd like to know what you think, though.
If you have any thoughts on how the look and feel of the document could be improved, and what further changes you'd like to see to the content, we'd be very interested to hear about it.
Please comment here in the first instance.
