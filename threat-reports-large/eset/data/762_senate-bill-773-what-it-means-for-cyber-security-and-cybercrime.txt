Allow me to frame the threat of cybercrime that we all face by quoting from Jeff Debrosse’s 2009 Cybersecurity Review white paper: Cybercriminals are global and often well organized.
They are smaller and more maneuverable than most corporations.
Some are sheltered by certain G8 economic countries’ policies and laws.
Their thefts fuel their home country’s
Allow me to frame the threat of cybercrime that we all face by quoting from Jeff Debrosse’s 2009 Cybersecurity Review white paper:
Cybercriminals are global and often well organized.
They are smaller and more maneuverable than most corporations.
Some are sheltered by certain G8 economic countries’ policies and laws.
Their thefts fuel their home country’s economy and they aren’t prosecuted if the crime is beyond the border.
They collaborate in the design and use of malware as their tools.
The cybercriminals are faster and have shelter from litigation and arrest.
We are up for the challenge, but this doesn’t fall strictly on the shoulders of the government.
Those of us in the private sector can do much more to contribute.
With President Obama citing an estimated $1 trillion in global intellectual property lost annually, we’ve got to do something or every bit of Intellectual Property our innovative little elves in keebler trees can think up will be offshored and in production before the patent ink dries on the application.
Let me bring this threat of stolen IP closer to home for most of us.
It’s not just about knockoff handbags or $5 pirated copies of Windows OS, it’s about manufactured items like counterfeit safety parts infiltrating parts pipelines.
The bottom line is that where there’s no oversight in manufacturing to keep people from saving a buck or three by using a weaker than specified alloy or failure rated part, there’s no guarantee you will get the quality required to save your life.
Like the airbags in your car.
Or the brakes on the commercial jet you’re flying in.
