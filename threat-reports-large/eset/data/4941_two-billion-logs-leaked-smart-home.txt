The leak, which has since been plugged, exposed a range of highly specific and sensitive information about users
UPDATE: According to this Bleeping Computer report, the company has secured the server and taken additional measures to protect the data of its customers.
A Chinese smart home solutions provider has been leaking billions of logs from devices managed via the company’s cloud platform, exposing a range of sensitive information about their users.
The database – which was found sitting an ElasticSearch server with no password protection – belongs to a Chinese company called Orvibo.
Its platform, called SmartMate, is used by customers from around the world to manage their Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, including home entertainment and security devices, and energy management and HVAC systems.
A maker of around 100 smart home or smart automation products, Orvibo claims to have a million customers, both individual users and businesses.
Researchers at vpnMentor, who discovered the misconfigured server in the middle of June and described their findings in this blog post, wrote that Orvibo has been notified of the issue several times since June 16.
Per latest reports (from yesterday), the database remains exposed.
There is no evidence that cybercriminals have accessed the data, but with such abundance of identifying information the scope for abuse is practically endless.
Says ESET cybersecurity specialist Jake Moore: “Criminal groups may have been aware of this data exposure, but it is unknown if anyone has taken advantage of this leak yet and I’d hope it would be plugged quite quickly now it is out.
What a criminal hacker could do with this goes as far as their imagination will take them”.
The user logs – no fewer than two billion of them, in fact – contain a collection of truly varied and very specific data.
There are user IDs, family names and IDs, email addresses, hashed (but not salted) passwords, smart device details, precise location data, IP addresses, as well as account reset codes, which could be used to lock people out of their accounts.
Scheduling information for things such as smart lights is also there for anyone to see.
