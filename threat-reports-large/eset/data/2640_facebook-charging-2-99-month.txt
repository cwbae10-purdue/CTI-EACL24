Thousands of Facebook addicts are feverishly sharing a “news report” claiming that from November 1st you’ll be paying $2.99 every month to access the site.
Will Facebook start charging you to access the world’s most popular social network?
Of course not.
But that isn’t stopping thousands of Facebook addicts from feverishly sharing a link to what they believe is a news report claiming that from November 1st you’ll be paying $2.99 every month.
If you click through on the link you will be taken to a satirical news website, not a legitimate news outlet, which has a phoney news report claiming that Facebook will soon be charging its billion users for access.
It’s nonsense of course.
If it were in anyway true, you would expect to see an announcement on Facebook’s official blog, or in the headlines of major online news outlets.
