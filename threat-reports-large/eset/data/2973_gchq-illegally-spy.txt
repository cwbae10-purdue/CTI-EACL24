Law enforcement agencies shouldn’t be above the law.
Find out if the UK’s GCHQ illegally spied on you…
Want to know if UK intelligence agency GCHQ has been covertly spying on you?
Now here’s your chance.
Surveillance and privacy watchdog Privacy International has launched an initiative to help people discover if their internet activity and private communications were secretly and illegally spied upon by British intelligence outfit, GCHQ.
Earlier this month, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) – which normally rubber stamps the activities of Britain’s spy agencies – slapped the wrists of GCHQ, censuring the spy agency for breaching human rights law.
According to the IPT, the British intelligence service acted unlawfully in accessing the personal communications of millions of people, collected by the NSA’s PRISM and UPSTREAM surveillance programs.
That intelligence-sharing between the USA and UK was unlawful prior to December 2014, because the rules governing GCHQ’s access to PRISM and UPSTREAM were secret.
To be within the law, the rules for data interception from people’s private phone calls, emails, and other internet communications have to be clear, accessible and public.
