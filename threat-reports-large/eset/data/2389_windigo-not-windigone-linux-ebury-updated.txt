There have been some interesting new developments since we published our report on Operation Windigo.
In this blog post you will read about a Linux/Ebury update, and the reaction of the criminal gang to our post.
There have been some interesting new developments since we published our report on Operation Windigo.
In this blog post you will read about a Linux/Ebury update, more details around our publicly released indicators of compromise (IOC), and we wanted to thank the security community for its help since the release of the report.
As previously described at length, Linux/Ebury is an OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer that is the backbone of the operation.
It provides the malicious group with all the server resources it needs to run all the other malware services, be it Linux/Cdorked, Perl/Calfbot, or its own infrastructure.
As we were in the process of publishing the report, we stumbled upon version 1.3.5 of Linux/Ebury.
We shared the sample, but were unable to provide more details about it in the original report due to time constraints.
The criminal gang behind Linux/Ebury has updated the code that deals with the shared memory segment so as to restrict its permissions.
The permissions were rather broad previously (666) and they have restricted them to only the owner (600).
