Somewhere back in the Dark Ages, I wrote some articles for Computer Weekly in the UK, as part of a series of articles called Security Zone.
This is a regular series where the contributors are all members of (ISC)2, the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium*.
Some of those articles are accessible from the Computer Weekly web site here including a couple of mine here and here.
The latest is on runtime packers and malware naming, but itâ€™s not available on the web site at the moment.
However, if you subscribe to the digital or hard copy version of Computer Weekly, you might find it of interest (or not).
If you like your articles a little geekier, my paper for the Cybercrime Forensics Education and Training Conference (CFET) last week should be available on the white papers page shortly, and deals with the naming issue in much more detail.
[Update: available on my own site as The Game of the Name: Malware Naming, Shape Shifters and Sympathetic Magic.]
