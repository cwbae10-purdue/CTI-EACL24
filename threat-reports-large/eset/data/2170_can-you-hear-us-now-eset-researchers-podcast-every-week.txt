Have you checked out the weekly podcast by ESET security researchers?
It’s called the ESET Malware Report and it covers many security and privacy topics in handy 5 to 10 minute audio interviews.
Chances are that if you are reading this blog post, you are already familiar with We Live Security’s mixture of advice, news, commentary and threat research.
But, did you know that We Live Security also has a weekly podcast?
It’s called the ESET Malware Report, and can be found by clicking on the Multimedia tab right above this article.
While our blog has a wide-ranging focus because security is such a big field, our podcasts are a little more finely-tuned: Our experts mean to provide both consumers and businesses with practical and relevant information about threats, plus tips and advice how to avoid them and stay safe online.
Most podcasts are between five to ten minutes long and can be listened to on your computer, smartphone, iPod or other MP3 player.
You can listen via your browser if you visit the page for the podcast you want to hear, or use the download link on that page to store it on your computer for listening later or transfer to another device.
