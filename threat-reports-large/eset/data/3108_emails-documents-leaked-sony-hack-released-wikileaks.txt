Hundreds and thousands of documents and emails breached during last Christmas’ cyberattack on Sony Pictures have been published on WikiLeaks, reports the BBC.
Hundreds and thousands of documents and emails breached during last Christmas’ cyberattack on Sony Pictures have been published on WikiLeaks, reports the BBC.
The documents – 170,000 emails and over 200 documents – are “fully searchable” with a “Google-style search engine”, according to The Guardian.
Although the stolen documents have been publicly available since the widely reported on hack from last year, this step by WikiLeaks makes everything significantly easier to navigate.
The Guardian claims the stolen data comprises several terabytes of data, though the video material is redacted on the WikiLeaks site.
Sony has acted with anger at the indexing, calling WikiLeaks’ move a “malicious criminal act.”
A spokesperson told Sky News, “The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm Sony Pictures Entertainment and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort.”
“We vehemently disagree with WikiLeaks’ assertion that this material belongs in the public domain and will continue to fight for the safety, security, and privacy of our company and its more than 6,000 employees.”
Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, justified the publication as showing the inner functioning of a multinational company in the public interest.
“This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation.
It is newsworthy and at the centre of a geopolitical conflict.
It belongs in the public domain.
WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there,” he said.
