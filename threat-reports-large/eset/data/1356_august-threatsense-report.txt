ESET's August ThreatSense report is now available on the Threat Center page.
It includes:
A feature article by Urban Schrott on the degree to which the Irish expose themselves to holiday-related scamming peril by revealing their plans on social media sites
A follow-up to/expanded version of an earlier article of mine for SC Magazine on possible legal consequences of the use of social media by rioters et al in the UK
Some of the most interesting blog articles from here from August from Cameron Camp and Aryeh Goretsky, plus a discussion between Aryeh and myself relating to his paper on Possibly Unwanted Applications
