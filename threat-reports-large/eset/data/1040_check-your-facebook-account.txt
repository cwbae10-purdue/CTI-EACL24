Facebook is rolling out a new look for user profiles.
Facebook started making its new profile optional last month, but is now forcing the new format on all users.
At least one security expert I know indicated that his privacy settings were not maintained when his account was switched to the new format.

Facebook is rolling out a new look for user profiles.
Facebook started making its new profile optional last month, but is now forcing the new format on all users.
At least one security expert I know indicated that his privacy settings were not maintained when his account was switched to the new format.
On Facebook in the upper right corner of the page there is a drop down menu labeled “Account”.
There are submenu items to change your account settings and privacy settings.
It is a good idea to review these settings and make sure they are how you want them to be set.
If you choose to customize your settings you can make some information not visible to anyone.
I have found that using Firefox with HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript, and Cookie Monster I am not able to change my privacy settings, but I’m not certain which plug in is interfering.
