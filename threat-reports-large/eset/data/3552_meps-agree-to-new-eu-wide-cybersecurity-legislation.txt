MEPs in the European Parliament have agreed on the need for EU-wide cybersecurity legislation, which will establish a common framework for all member states to subscribe to.
The European Parliament has agreed to new rules that will underpin new cybersecurity legislation.
This deal is the first of its kind in the European Union.
Günther H. Oettinger, the EU’s commissioner for digital economy and society, explained that MEPs across the continent had come to a “political agreement” over the matter.
The legislation, he said, will help establish a common framework that member states are obliged to follow when dealing with this growing challenge.
Lauding the achievement as “a major step” forward in boosting cybersecurity in Europe, Mr. Oettinger said that this threat is something that must be tackled with “great urgency”.
These new rules will have an impact on European countries and businesses within them in three significant ways, the German politician went on to say in his blog.
