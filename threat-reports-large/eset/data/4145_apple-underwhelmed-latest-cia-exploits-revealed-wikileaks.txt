WikiLeaks’s revelations about security vulnerabilities in Apple products appear to be a damp squib.
Earlier this month WikiLeaks made the headlines releasing what claimed to be leaked secret CIA documents detailing methods by which it exploited vulnerabilities and used hacking tools to spy upon persons of interest.
The “Vault 7” press release issued by WikiLeaks included allegations that the CIA had developed methods to secretly listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones.
Technology firms including Apple, Samsung and Microsoft responded to the allegations by claiming that they would vigorously investigate any reported weaknesses, and requesting that the organisation headed by Julian Assange responsibly disclose any technical details they might have of security flaws.
According to media reports, however, WikiLeaks wasn’t entirely comfortable with sharing information without stipulating a few demands of its own – including its wish to exercise its right to make details of the flaws public if they were not fixed by vendors within 90 days.
Yesterday WikiLeaks continued its “Vault 7” revelations, sharing specific details of the CIA’s efforts to spy specifically on iOS and Mac users – albeit when agents had managed to gain physical access to their intended target’s devices.
Is it time for Apple users to run to the hills in a blind panic that their treasured devices can no longer be trusted?
