The IRS, the United States government agency for collecting taxes, has admitted that for more than two months malicious hackers targeted its systems, and managed to gain access to information about more than 100,000 tax payers.
As Associated Press reports, the hackers managed to steal tax returns and other tax information filed with the IRS, between February and mid-May of this year.
The hackers are said to have accessed a system called “Get Transcript”, a service which is designed to allow tax payers to review their tax account transactions line-by-line for a specific tax year – something which is apparently useful for those applying for mortgages or help with college fees.
However, according to a statement issued by the IRS, the online criminals managed to waltz through the “Get Transcript” service’s security page, which normally requires users to enter information such as their social security number, date of birth, tax filing status and street address to access the system.
It is feared that up to $50 million worth of fraudulent refunds could have been made so far using information taken from the stole transcripts.
However, that figure may rise if the information on old returns is further exploited in the future.
