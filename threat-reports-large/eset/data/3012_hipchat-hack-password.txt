Use HipChat?
Be aware that hackers have accessed the names, usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords for some users.
Australian enterprise software firm Atlassian has told customers that it recently suffered a security breach that saw hackers access names, usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords for users of its HipChat group messaging application.
According to Craig Davies, who heads up Atlassian’s security team, “a very small percentage” (less than 2%) of the firm’s customers are affected.
