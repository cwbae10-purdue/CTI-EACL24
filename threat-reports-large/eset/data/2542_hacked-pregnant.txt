An embedded microchip that stops you from becoming pregnant?
Would you trust it to protect itself properly from a hacker attack?
We put trust in technology every day.
We drive a car to work, and trust that its brakes won’t fail too badly, and that its engine won’t explode in a massive fireball on the dual carriageway.
We tap words into a computer, and trust that someone didn’t goof up the wiring and that we’re not going to get an electric shock.
We drink water, and trust that the computers at the water filtration plant didn’t go wacko and allow some toxic element to make its way into the taps in our houses.
It’s clear that we trust technology a lot.
And with some very important things.
So, it’s interesting that some things that technology can help with seem to automatically send a shiver down our security spines.
Take MicroCHIPs, for instance.
They’re a company from Lexington, Massachusetts, whose tagline is “programmable drug delivery” and describe claim to specialise in “intelligent implanted devices designed to improve the health of millions of people”.
