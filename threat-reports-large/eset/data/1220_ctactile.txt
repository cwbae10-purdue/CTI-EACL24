…if you’re a Facebook user, you might want to try the CTAC Facebook page.
I’ve taken to posting links to CTAC output there at the same time as I tweet it…
…or staying in touch with CTAC (the Cyber Threat Analysis Center), whose personnel are mostly responsible for the content of this blog.
A couple of weeks ago I mentioned various ways in which you can keep track of what the CTAC team is up to, but if you're a Facebook user, you might want to try the CTAC Facebook page.
I've taken to posting links to CTAC output there at the same time as I tweet it.
Just for reference, here are some other links I mentioned:
Twitter accounts – @esetresearch, @eset_ctac, @dharleyatESET, @ESETLLC, @esetkb, @ESET
There's also an ESET USA Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/esetusa, and an ESET global page http://www.facebook.com/esetsoftware.
There are lots of regional ESET FB pages, too: too many to list here, I'm afraid.
