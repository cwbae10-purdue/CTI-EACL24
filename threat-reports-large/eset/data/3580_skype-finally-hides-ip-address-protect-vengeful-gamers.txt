For too long streaming video gamers have suffered denial-of-service attacks and raids from police SWAT teams, often assisted by Skype leaking private IP addresses.
Over five years ago, in November 2010, security researchers found a serious privacy vulnerability in Skype that could allow hackers to surreptitiously scoop up sensitive information about users, including victimsâ€™ IP addresses and revealing their city-level location.
The researchers who found the flaw were part of the French research institute Inria and the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, and chose to keep their findings out of the public eye, only sharing them with Microsoft-owned Skype.
However, in May 2012, a year and a half after being informed about the flaw, news of the still unpatched vulnerability hit the headlines after a web-based tool was published that helped hackers identify the last known IP address of a Skype user.
You might like to imagine that stirred by the news going public Microsoft stopped resting on its laurels and moved quickly to fix the problem.
Keep dreaming.
