AMTSOâ€™s discussions on its own new directions, and updates to its testing-related resources.
In a recent blog I linked to my recent EICAR paper on AMTSO, but I also referred to an upcoming AMTSO workshop (last week in Munich, which explains the entirely gratuitous photograph taken at the Weihenstephan brewery) in which I anticipated a great deal of discussion about future directions.
Having returned a few days ago from that workshop, I put my first reactions to those discussions in an article for SC Magazine's Cybercrime Corner called AMTSO turns pro, which was put up today.
