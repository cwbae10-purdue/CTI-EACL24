Planning your 2015 budget?
Forecasting 2015 sales?
Don’t forget a plan to survive “adverse events” from hurricanes to viruses, virtual and medical.
This recorded webinar will help you get started with business continuity management or BCM.
Business continuity is a term that can sound strange the first time you hear it; after all, you probably have every intention of being in business for the long haul.
Right now you may be preparing the 2015 sales forecast and budget, with hopes for a great year ahead.
But in your planning, have you thought about how your business would handle the bad things that can happen, from a computer virus outbreak to a biological virus outbreak, and all the other perils in-between, like fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis?
Putting a plan in place to survive such “adverse events” is the goal of business continuity management or BCM, and it could well be the key to securing your digital future.
