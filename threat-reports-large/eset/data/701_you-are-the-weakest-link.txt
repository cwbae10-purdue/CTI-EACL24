Greetings, friends and fiends.
It's been a while since I've been able to blog: I've been trying out one of these vacation thingies that I keep reading about in travel magazines.
(Well, my wife does, and she tells me when I need a holiday, presumably as my conversations get grouchier.)

In an article for CTO Edge, he talks about the use of social engineering in malware.
Social engineering and malware have been enjoying a dangerous liaison for a long time, of course, but it's never a bad time ot point out that psychological manipulation remains the most successful vector for malware infection (and other attacks, of course), and the article includes some very apposite examples of the technique.
And dare I mention that it's platform-independent?
