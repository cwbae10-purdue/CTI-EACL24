Alonzo Knowles was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty in a separate case involving the hacking of female celebrities’ online accounts
It turns out that the hacking of celebrity email accounts to scoop up their intimate photos and private conversations didn’t end with 2014’s notorious “Fappening” (perhaps more politely termed “CelebGate”).
Then, female celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, Avril Lavigne, Kate Hudson, and Rihanna had their email accounts compromised and intimate pictures stolen.
That would be bad enough, but the pictures were then shared widely across the internet without any consideration of how the innocent victims must have been feeling.
This week, a 24-year-old hacker named Alonzo Knowles was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty in a separate case involving the hacking of female celebrities’ online accounts.
Knowles didn’t stop at stealing what he found in the hacked accounts.
He attempted to sell the private emails, unpublished TV and movie scripts, and sexually explicit pictures and videos he stole from them.
The bad news for Knowles, and the good news for those female celebrities that he had targeted, was that the person he was trying to sell the stolen material to was an undercover law enforcement officer.
