I hear from ESET colleagues in the UK that the BBC's Radio 6 homepage (one of the Beeb's music stations) is currently afflicted by a malicious link, detected by ESET's products as HTML/Iframe.B.Gen.
The link is to a site flagged by a number of other resources as carrying malware.
The BBC have been informed, but at the time of writing the page was still compromised, and I'm in the process of finding a more direct contact.
Jonathan Deane also pointed me (I'm at RSA and not connected to the Internet most of the time) to an announcement at http://lush.com.au/ indicating that Lush's Australian and New Zealand web pages have been compromised, suggesting that customer data may have been stolen, and advising anyone who's placed an online order with the company to check with their bank to see if they should cancel their credit card.
