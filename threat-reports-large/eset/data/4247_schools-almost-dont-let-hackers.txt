Cybersecurity should be a priority for educational institutions, says ESET’s Lysa Myers.
It’s important to protect students and staff from cybercriminals.
When it comes to security, schools have unique challenges.
It’s difficult to think of another type of organization that combines the functions of education, healthcare, finance, retail, and research, among the other usual administrative departments like human resources and accounting.
When you couple this breadth of service with an alphabet soup of security compliance regulations, the expectation of an openness of information within and without the organization, and potentially a very limited budget, security becomes orders of magnitude more challenging than usual.
Cybercriminals are seizing this opportunity with increasing force, and schools are feeling the squeeze.
In Educause’s 2015 poll, security issues occupied the bottom slots of the top ten areas of concern for CIOs and IT leaders in education.
In 2016 and 2017, Information Security was considered the number one IT issue.
For better or worse, the retail and healthcare industries have had their day in the spotlight because of the sheer enormity of the losses from a few of the more notable breach victims.
This has forced both industries to address their shortcomings in a very public way, due to governmental and customer pressure.
The lack of mega breaches contributing massive numbers of lost records may give some educational institutions a false sense of the size of the problem.
According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, there were only 19 breaches in the education sector in 2016, comprising fewer than 65,000 records.
