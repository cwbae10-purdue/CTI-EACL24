A new report finds that in the world of business, it is in fact IT workers who are the riskiest users of technology.
The business world’s riskiest user of technology is likely to be someone working in IT, according to a new study.
Intermedia’s Insider Risk Report 2015 found that contrary to what most people may expect, IT professionals have some of the “poorest security habits” in the workplace.
The statistics showed that in comparison with colleagues in other departments, those in IT were less inclined to adhere to best practice.
The report revealed, for example, that 65 percent of IT professionals share web login details with multiple users, compared to 46 percent “across all functions”.
Similarly, when asked whether they would access company information after leaving, 22 percent of IT workers responded yes.
Only six percent of people outside of this department admitted they would.
“I was surprised by this,” commented Mike Maendler, CEO of Technology & Beyond.
“As an IT services provider, my company is on the frontline against intrusions, hacks and interruptions caused by these exact kinds of practices.
“One of our biggest priorities is to keep data secure and confidential, and it shocks me that other IT people wouldn’t share the same outlook.”
Other notable findings include Millennials being less secure than Gen Xers and Baby Boomers.
This was a revelation for the authors of the paper.
Jonathan Levine, CTO of Intermedia, said that he would have expected Millennials to be “more sophisticated” in this regard.
Given that they have grown up with technology, this demographic – 16-35 year-olds – “should have better habits”, he added.
It is an interesting finding, as a new survey from Intercede observed that this age group are in fact sceptical about how secure their online data is.
The poll suggested that they need more assurance from businesses and governments over data security.
