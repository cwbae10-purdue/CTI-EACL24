Some of you witnessed the unexpected – ESET missed a VB100 in the April VB Linux comparative due to a false positive in the clean set.
We are pleased to announce that following discussions with the staff of Virus Bulletin they have reversed that decision and granted ESET our 43rd VB100 award.
The Virus Bulletin web site states at http://www.virusbtn.com/news/vb_news/2007/05_04.xml
“In Virus Bulletin’s April 2007 Linux comparative review (see VB, April 2007, p.11), VB reported that ESET’s product NOD32 had generated a false positive during scanning of the older part of the clean test set.
after further investigation and careful consideration, VB now deems that the file alerted on was inappropriate for inclusion in the clean test set.
The file will be removed from the clean test set with immediate effect.
A VB100 is therefore awarded to NOD32.
No other products were affected.”
Virus Bulletin enjoys a rare position of respect in the anti-virus community due to their exceptional endeavors to provide scientifically repeatable and relevant testing.
While reversals are rare, Virus Bulletin has never been afraid to reverse a decision if they deem it the correct thing to do.
Many testers have their egos so entwined in their testing that they simply cannot ever admit that maybe they didn’t do things as best they could.
Virus Bulletin does things as best as they can because their ego is in quality testing and not in pretending that, unlike the rest of us, they are perfect.
When I worked at Microsoft I always valued the results of Virus Bulletin testing above other tests I read.
The reason was simple.
