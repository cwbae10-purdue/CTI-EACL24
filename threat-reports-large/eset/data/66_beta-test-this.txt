Here’s my thought process.
1) I don’t know the company sending me this.
2) I didn’t sign up to be on a beta list, even if I did know the company.

4) I assume anything asking me to download software is trying to infect my computer unless I have very, very good reason to believe otherwise.
It’s just that simple.
