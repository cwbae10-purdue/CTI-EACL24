Google has announced that it is piloting a new sign-in system that will, if successful, replace passwords.
User authentication will be delivered through a smartphone.
Google has confirmed that it is testing a new login system that intends to make passwords a thing of the past.
News of this was first revealed on Reddit by systems engineer Rohit Paul, who posted a thread titled ‘Just got early access to log into Google account without password’.
The tech giant said: “We’ve invited a small group of users to help test a new way to sign-in to their Google accounts, no password required.
‘Pizza’, ‘password’ and ‘123456’—your days are numbered.”
Mr. Paul was kind enough to post details of how the system works.
First, you set up your device so that it allows you to log into your account.
Second, you open up Google on a computer or laptop and click on the sign-in tab at the top right of the screen.
Third, you type in your email – so far so normal – and then click on the next tab.
However, in this instance, the following page doesn’t ask for a password.
Instead, it asks you to use your phone to gain access to your account – and then for you to check your device.
It advises that you “pull down the notification bar and tap the sign-in notification”.
After tapping yes, you are offered an authenticity test.
In the example given by Mr. Paul, it is to tap one of three numbers.
After you have successfully completed these steps, you will then be logged into your account – without having to type in a long, complicated password.
In instances where a user can’t sign-in using their smartphone – i.e.
their battery has died or they have left their device at home – users can log in with their password.
If however you lose your smartphone, Google explains that with a lock screen or touch ID authentication, you should be protected.
