The recently released Brad Pitt film ‘Fury’ was amongst the titles leaked, but others were yet to be released formally be the studio, including ‘Annie’, ‘Still Alice’, ‘Mr.
Turner’, and ‘To Write Love On Her Arms.”
Five films have been leaked online following last week’s Sony Pictures hacking, reports SC Magazine.
The recently released Brad Pitt film ‘Fury’ was amongst the titles leaked, but others were yet to be released, including ‘Annie’, ‘Still Alice’, ‘Mr.
Turner’, and ‘To Write Love On Her Arms.”
While the studio initially played down talk of a full-scale hack, by stating they were looking into an “I.T matter”, developments have since developed into global headlines.
Last week, employees at Sony Pictures Entertainment found their screens were invaded by a skull alongside a message threatening to release data secrets if certain (undisclosed) demands were not met.
As of yet, nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, but one theory gaining traction on news sites is that the hack is the responsibility of North Korean hackers, angry at an upcoming movie the studio is working on.
‘The Interview’ – starring Seth Rogan and James Franco on a mission to assassinate the country’s leader Kim Jong-Un – has already drawn criticism from North Korea, with Pyongyang contacting Hollywood, the UN and the White House over their dissatisfaction with the content of the film, which is due out on Christmas Day.
The Telegraph reports that North Korean state media has described the film as “a wanton act of terror” that deserves “merciless countermeasures” if it is released.
When asked by Reuters about the country’s involvement in the Sony Pictures hacking, a spokesman for North Korea’s U.N. mission offered a non-denial: “The hostile forces are relating everything to the DPRK [North Korea].
I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”
