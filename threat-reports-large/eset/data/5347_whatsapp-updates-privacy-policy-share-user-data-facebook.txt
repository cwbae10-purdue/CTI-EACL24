Many users have until February 8 to accept the new rules – or else lose access to the app
UPDATE (January 18th, 2021): WhatsApp announced that it would postpone the rollout of the new data-sharing practices.
In a major update to its Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, WhatsApp is notifying users in many parts of the world that as of February 8 it will share some of their data with Facebook, the chat app’s parent company.
Importantly, users who won’t agree to the new terms will need to stop using the app or delete their accounts.
The notice is being shared via an in-app notification that maps the key updates to WhatsApp’s policies and terms of service.
Those are divided into three key points – how the app processes user data, how businesses can use Facebook-hosted services with WhatsApp, and how the app partners with Facebook to offer integration across Facebook’s products.
Note, however, that users in Europe will be exempt from the service’s new data-sharing practices and are only shown the first two of the three points in the notice.
WhatsApp’s director of policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Niamh Sweeney attempted to clear up some confusion that had arisen around the issue:
3/5 There are no changes to WhatsApp's data-sharing practices in the Europe arising from this update.
It remains the case that WhatsApp does not share European Region WhatsApp user data with Facebook for the purpose of Facebook using this data to improve its products or ads.

How about the rest of the world, though?
Here’s an important part of the platform’s updated ToS as they will apply to the users in other parts of the world:
“As part of the Facebook Companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, the Facebook Companies as described in WhatsApp’s Privacy Policy, including to provide integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experience with other Facebook Company Products; to ensure security, safety, and integrity across the Facebook Company Products; and to improve your ads and products experience across the Facebook Company Products,”

Your profile picture and profile information
The phone numbers of your WhatsApp contacts
Transaction and payments data
Location information
Information about your device such as the model, operating system, and mobile network
