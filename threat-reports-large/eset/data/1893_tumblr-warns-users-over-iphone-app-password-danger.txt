Micro-blogging site Tumblr has warned users that passwords can be “sniffed” from its iPhone and iPad apps – and issued a “very important” security update for both apps.
Tumblr also warned users who have been using these apps to update their password on Tumblr – and change passwords elsewhere if users have shared the same one.
The warning was issued via an official company blog, and will appear in the timeline of users with the iPhone app.
Tumblr only became aware of the security issue on Tuesday, according to TheNextWeb.
The security issue allowed passwords to be “”Sniffed” in transit on certain versions of the app”, Tumblr revealed in a post.
“We have just released a very important security update for our iPhone and iPad apps addressing an issue that allowed passwords to be compromised in certain circumstances.
Please download the update now,” the site said in its post.
