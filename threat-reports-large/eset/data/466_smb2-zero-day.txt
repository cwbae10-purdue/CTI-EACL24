Some traffic has crossed my radar concerning a 0-day exploit that apparently enables a remote attacker to crash a Vista or Windows 7 system with SMB enabled (and according to subsequent reports, Server 2008).
The original post and exploit are claimed to demonstrate the possibility of a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) and (normally) an automatic reboot when the SMB2 driver fails to handle malformed headers correctly.
However, subsequent traffic on a specialist mailing list indicates that the underlying vulnerability could also be used to effect remote code execution and local privilege escalation.
SecurityFocus has subsequently reported this as a remote code execution vulnerability, and cites a CVE reference CVE-2009-3103, but this isn’t listed at CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits) at time of writing.
According to the Internet Storm Center, a Microsoft advisory has become available: “Microsoft Security Advisory (975497) Vulnerabilities in SMB Could Allow Remote Code Execution”, at www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/975497.mspx: however, I’m just getting an error message on that URL right now.
This vulnerability is not addressed by this month’s “Patch Tuesday” updates.
A preliminary analysis from the University of Minnesota passed onto a specialist list suggests that the exploit defaults to 445/tcp, and suggests some possible mitigations:
Set firewalls to deny inbound file and print sharing, or set network location to “public”
Disable SMB2 (I believe this is enabled by default – DH)
Brian Eckman, the analyst in question, notes that “..the steps taken for servers require a registry change and a reboot, while disabling the SMB2 client appears to only require a couple commands to be run.” So administrators on large sites will need to warn end users and departments before applying mitigation on such machines.
