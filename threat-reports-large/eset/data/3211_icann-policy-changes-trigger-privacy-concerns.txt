Internet name authority ICANN has unsettled privacy advocates after a new working group document flagged changes to the way domain proxy services can operate.
Internet name authority ICANN has unsettled privacy advocates after a new working group document flagged changes to the way domain proxy services can operate.
The changes, proposed in a document (PDF) from a working group of the Generic Names Supporting Organization at ICANN, essentially mean that “registrants of websites engaged in active commerce” would no longer be allowed to protect the personal information of domain owners using a proxy service.
Proxy services prevent domain owners’ personal contact details from appearing publicly on the internet – sites that cover sensitive, controversial, or politically motivated content for example, or simply site owners that wish to retain their personal privacy use them widely.
However, a number of companies, including Facebook and brand protection company MarkMonitor, believe that the situation should be changed to bring domain name rules in line with “global law and policy”.
However, this is highly contentious.
