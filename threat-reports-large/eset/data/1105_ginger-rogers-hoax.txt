I've been coming across several references to an email and Facebook hoax relating to a YouTube that's claimed to show 92-year-old Ginger Rogers dancing with her great-grandson.
Of course, it isn't: she died in 1995 in her 80s.
This isn't a threat: it's a genuine movie and an interesting enough story to stand on its own,
