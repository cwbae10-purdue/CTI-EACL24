It is quite possible that a proprietary hardware device failure could cause such a problem, but one would expect that a back up for such a critical piece of hardware would be stocked for immediate disaster recovery.
Another plausible explanation would be that faults were found in routine backups and recoveries of older backups were not stored online or locally.
If the problem was due to a hacker (cyber attack) then it is quite understandable that the system would be offline for such a long period of time.
It can take quite a while to investigate and determine the scope, impact, and depth of such attacks.
