Lloyds Banking Group fell victim to an attempted cyberattack earlier this month, which saw cybercriminals attempt to crash the online banking service over a two day period.
Lloyds Banking Group in the UK was subjected to a distributed denial of service attack, it has been revealed.
Over the course of two days (January 11th to 13th), cybercriminals targeted the bank, leaving many of its customers unable to properly access its online services.
According to the Financial Times, which first reported the story, this DDoS attack was part of a larger effort to take down some of the biggest banks in the UK.
While Lloyds Banking Group has declined to comment on the exact details of the attack, it said in a statement:
“We experienced intermittent service issues with internet banking between Wednesday morning and Friday afternoon the week before last and are sorry for any inconvenience caused.
“We will not speculate on the cause of these intermittent issues.”
The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre is now working with the bank on the incident.
This is latest in a number of attacks targeting UK banks.
More recently, Tesco Bank was hit with “a systematic, sophisticated attack“.
As a result, the bank paid out £2.5 million to the 9,000 customers that had been affected by the incident.
“Anybody wishing DDoS attacks would go away is in for a rude awakening.”
Neustar’s 2016 Worldwide DDoS Attacks & Protection Report concluded that DDoS attacks are likely to “continue at a fervent pace”.
