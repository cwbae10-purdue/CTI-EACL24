The buzz about Bitcoin has moved from online circles to mainstream media sources.
Last week’s news of the collapse of exchange Mt.
Gox got more play than in just the business section.
Everyone seems to be interested in the digital, anonymous, and stateless currency.
Governments have made pronouncements, law enforcement has investigated its use in money laundering, and legitimate businesses such as retailers and restaurants have begun to accept Bitcoin for payments.
In recent McAfee Labs Threats Reports, we have offered timelines that showed the volatility in Bitcoin valuation.
The timeline continues here for the most recent quarter, which saw the currency jump from US$136 in value to $1,242 before finishing the quarter at $820, a sixfold increase for the period.
For more on cybercrime, vulnerabilities, and malware, see the newly released McAfee Labs Threats Report: Fourth Quarter 2013.

Following the coins
Black market websites for stolen data (date of birth, social security number, address, and credit card number, etc.)
are numerous on the Internet.
They come and go for a variety of reasons, including avoiding law enforcement attempts to shut them down and arrest the principals.
To attract new buyers, these sites advertise via spam emails.
By multiplying the number of sites online, the crooks multiply their profits.
And by accepting digital currencies such as Bitcoin, these crooks can also rip off novice criminals.
When a sufficient number of buyers purchase stolen credit card data, a site will disappear.
Because digital currencies are exchanged irreversibly and almost anonymously, the money stays in the site owner’s hands.
Even for criminals, the buyer must beware.
Using Bitcoin is not fully anonymous.
A criminal can publicly link his name to a wallet address; that error can be dangerous.
For this reason some cybercriminals have jumped to other types of virtual money, including Zerocoin.

Successfully following the money trail requires an in-depth investigation.
