We recently received a sample of the malware NGRBot from a customer, who got a spam email with what appears to be a Skype link.
Victims are lured into clicking a link that promises an image.
Once victims click the link, the file skype_09-10-12_image.exe gets dropped on their machines and launches itself, spamming all of their contacts.
This bot is also known as Dorgbot.
Kaspersky states that the malware was first seen on October 6.
The bot comes with Skype icon and tricks its victims into executing the file.
We have already written about NGRBot earlier here.
This sample comes with an additional module to steal credit card and login details.
The new bot module steals login credentials of victims from Gmail, AOL, FastMail, MoneyBookers, Megaupload, SpeedyShare, YouTube, iknowthatgirl, YouPorn, Brazzers, Webnames, Dotster, Enom, 1and1, Moniker, Namecheap, Godaddy, Alertpay, Netflix, Thepiratebay, Torrentleech, Vip-file, Sms4file, Letitbit, Whatcd, eBay, Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo, and PayPal, among others.
The malware can post its lure in different languages.

This malware is widespread.
We advise customers to be extra cautious when clicking on links, particularly those with words such as “pic” or image” that appear in the chat windows of messaging software.
Update
We have now seen this bot download and execute ransomware, which locks the victim’s machine and demands money to return control to the user.
The lock screen of the ransomware also rips off the McAfee logo.
This family of ransomware checks for the victim’s location and then produces the lock screen.
It charges about US$200 to release the desktop.
The malware modifies the registry entry “System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot” to prevent users from booting into Safe Mode.
The ransomware disables:
Taskmgr.exe
cmd.exe
regedit.exe
msconfig.exe
The most recent sample we received also shows porn images in the lock screen.
