Earlier today, George Kurtz posted an entry, ‘Operation “Aurora” Hit Google, Others’, Â on the McAfee’s Security Insight blogÂ The purpose of this blog is to answer questions about this particular attack; fill in some of the threat flow and McAfee coverage details.
How were systems compromised?
When a user manually loaded/navigated to a malicious web page from a vulnerable Microsoft Windows system, JavaScript code exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer;Â Microsoft Internet Explorer DOM Operation Memory Corruption Vulnerability.Â Microsoft has released Security Advisory (979352) for this vulnerability (CVE-2010-0249).
What was the payload of the exploit?
Once a system was successfully compromised, the exploit was designed to download and run an executable from a site, which has since been taken offline.Â That executable installed a remote access Trojan to load at startup.Â This Trojan also contacted a remote server.Â This allowed remote attackers to view, create, and modify information on the compromised system.
How wide-spread is this attack?
Aurora appears to have been a very concentrated attack on specific targets.Â It is not believed to be widespread at this time.
How serious is this vulnerability?
The Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerability leveraged in this attack allows for remote code execution, but does require user intervention (such as following a hyperlink to a website, or opening an email attachment, etc).Â Furthermore, the single exploit known to exist can be thwarted by Data Execution Prevention (DEP), enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8 and optionally in Internet Explorer 7.
Â Microsoft lists the following combinations to be vulnerable: Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, and Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 are affected.
