Recent political tensions in the Middle East region have led to significant speculation of increased cyber-related activities.
McAfee is on a heightened state of alert to monitor the evolving threats and rapidly implement coverage across all McAfee products as intelligence becomes available.
Known campaigns associated with the threat actors from this region were integrated into our products and we continue to monitor our global telemetry for any further activity.
We are observing activity that claim to be attributed from threat actors from this region, however, distinguishing attribution between cybercrime and nation state will be crucial since the line will likely blur.
For example, typical cybercrime activities such as ransomware, or indeed defacements or DDoS, could well be a mask for nation-state activities.
