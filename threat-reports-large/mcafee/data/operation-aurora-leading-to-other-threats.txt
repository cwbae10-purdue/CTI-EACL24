Operation Aurora has received a lot of attention over the past couple of days.Â To recap, Google, Adobe, and many other companies were attacked with code exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer.Â Since the announcement of this vulnerability (CVE-2010-0249), exploit code has been made public and already revised into a more usable form.
History tells us that when exploit code targeting an unpatched vulnerability in popular software is release; a slew of attackers are ready, willing, and able to capitalize.Â What started out as a sophisticated targeted attack is likely to lead to large-scale attacks on vulnerable Microsoft Internet Explorer users.Â This often takes the form of drive-by download sites serving malware to unsuspecting users, lured by links spammed in email, social networking sites, blogs, and poisoned search engine results.
