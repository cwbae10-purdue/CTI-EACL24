“Distrust and caution are the parents of security”–Benjamin Franklin
A recent threat targeting Chinese users of Mac OS X and iPhone came to light yesterday.
The malware, called WireLurker, is distributed by the Chinese third-party app store Maiyadi.
Since the threat’s discovery, more than 400 applications containing the Trojan were identified at the store.
Two very important characteristics of this Trojan are that infection is propagated from Mac OS X to any iOS device that is connected to the machine, and that even non-jailbroken devices are affected.
The malware arrives when the user downloads the Trojanized application from the alternate app store.
The Trojan executes and installs its files to the following folder:
/usr/local/machook
The files installed in this folder are then installed as a persistent service in Mac OS X, as shown in the following script:
At this point, the malware installs a USB hook callback, and waits for any iOS device to be connected to any USB port.
It will also report the infection to its control server at this URL:
hxxp:// www.
comeinbaby.
com/app/ getversion.php ?v=%@&adid=%@
Once a device is detected, the malware on Mac OS X performs the following actions to compromise the iOS device:
Get a list of all applications installed in the device
Get the hardware ID of the device
Submit this information to the control server
Create a backup on the local disk of all applications on the device
Inject the malicious iOS binary into each application
Install the applications on the device
Code to get the list of installed applications on the device.
The malware will perform the preceding actions even if the device is not jail broken.
To do this, the malware will attempt to install a security profile in the device.
This profile contains a fake digital certificate to sign the Trojan packages.
If the user accepts the installation of the security profile, any application signed by the digital certificate can be installed and executed without warning to the user.
After the Trojanized applications are installed on the device, any time the user starts one of them the malware will execute, too.
The malware can steal user information including contacts, bookmarks, email, etc.
It can also download and install additional applications to the device without user consent.
We have not yet seen other malicious files installed, but it is possible.
This behavior has been reported by users of the Maiyadi app store since August, but may have been overlooked because the blog is not in English:
A user reporting the Machook behavior on August 21.
All files related to the attack seem to have been developed by the same authors.
The following information is present in the iOS malware:
