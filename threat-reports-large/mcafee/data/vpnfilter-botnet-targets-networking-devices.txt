VPNFilter is a botnet with capabilities to support both intelligence collection and destructive cyberattack operations.
The Cisco Talos team recently notified members of the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) of its findings and published this blog.
The malware is believed to target networking devices, although the malwareâ€™s initial infection vector is still unclear.
Talos, which first reported this attack, claims that it has impacted at least 500,000 networking devices during the last few years.
The malware can persist on infected devices and can steal website credentials and monitor Modbus SCADA protocols.
It also implements file collection, command execution, data extraction, and device management and, even worse, it can render some or all of the infected devices unusable.
The known devices affected by VPNFilter are some network-attached storage (NAS) devices such as Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Link networking equipment in the small and home office (SOHO) space, as well at QNAP.
VPNFilter has a three-stage infection.
Stage 1 completes the persistence on the system and uses multiple control mechanisms to find and connect the Stage 2 deployment server.
Stage 2 focuses on file collection, command execution, data extraction, and device management.
Some versions possess a self-destruct capability to render itself unusable.
Stage 3 includes two known modules:
A traffic sniffer to steal website credentials and monitor Modbus SCADA protocols
Tor to communicate with anonymous addresses

Reboot SOHO routers and NAS devices to remove the potentially destructive, nonpersistent Stage 2 and Stage 3 malware
Work with the manufacturer to ensure that your device is up to date with the latest patches.
Apply the updated patches immediately.
ISPs should work aggressively with their customers to ensure their devices are patched to the most recent firmware/
