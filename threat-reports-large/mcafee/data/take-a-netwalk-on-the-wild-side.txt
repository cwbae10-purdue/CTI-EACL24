The NetWalker ransomware, initially known as Mailto, was first detected in August 2019.
Since then, new variants were discovered throughout 2019 and the beginning of 2020, with a strong uptick noticed in March of this year.
NetWalker has noticeably evolved to a more stable and robust ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, and our research suggests that the malware operators are targeting and attracting a broader range of technically advanced and enterprising criminal affiliates.
McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) discovered a large sum of bitcoins linked to NetWalker which suggest its extortion efforts are effective and that many victims have had no option other than to succumb to its criminal demands.
We approached our investigation of NetWalker with some possible ideas about the threat actor behind it, only to later disprove our own hypothesis.
We believe the inclusion of our thinking, and the means with which we debunked our own theory, highlight the importance of thorough research and we welcome further discussion on this topic.
We believe it starts valuable discussions and helps avoid duplicate research efforts by others.
We also encourage our peers in the industry to share information with us in case you have more evidence.

Since 2019, NetWalker ransomware has reached a vast number of different targets, mostly based in western European countries and the US.
Since the end of 2019, the NetWalker gang has indicated a preference for larger organisations rather than individuals.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the adversaries behind NetWalker clearly stated that hospitals will not be targeted; whether they keep to their word remains to be seen.
The ransomware appends a random extension to infected files and uses Salsa20 encryption.
It uses some tricks to avoid detection, such as a new defence evasion technique, known as reflective DLL loading, to inject a DLL from memory.
The NetWalker collective, much like those behind Maze, REvil and other ransomware, threatens to publish victims’ data if ransoms are not paid.
As mentioned earlier, NetWalker RaaS prioritizes quality over quantity and is looking for people who are Russian-speaking and have experience with large networks.
People who already have a foothold in a potential victim’s network and can exfiltrate data with ease are especially sought after.
This is not surprising, considering that publishing a victims’ data is part of NetWalker’s model.
The following sections are dedicated to introducing the NetWalker malware and displaying the telemetry status before moving on to the technical malware analysis of the ransomware’s behaviour.
We will explain how the decryptor works and show some interactions between NetWalker’s operators and their victims.
After this, we discuss the changes in modus operandi since September 2019, especially regarding payment behaviour.
Then we show our attempts, unfruitful as they were, at discovering a link between NetWalker and previous, seemingly unrelated ransomware variants.
Finally, we deliver an overview of IOCs related to NetWalker and its MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
Using McAfee’s billion Insights sensors, we can show the global prevalence of the NetWalker ransomware.

Before March 2020, the NetWalker ransom note indicated how to contact the adversary directly using anonymous email account services with random names (such as kkeessnnkkaa@cock.li and hhaaxxhhaaxx@tuta.io):

Example of ransom note prior to March 2020
On 12 March 2020, a researcher shared a screenshot of a new NetWalker ransom note in a tweet and we can see that the attackers have changed the contact method significantly.
Email communication has been dropped completely with victims now required to make contact through the NetWalker Tor interface where, after submitting their user key, they will then be redirected to a chat with NetWalker technical support.
This change in contact method coincides with underground forum postings where NetWalker revealed it was opening its RaaS up for new affiliates.
The Tor page was not the only noticeable change we will highlight in this blog.

NetWalker behavior
The NetWalker malware uses a custom resource type (1337 or 31337) containing its entire configuration.
This file is extracted to memory and decrypted using the RC4 algorithm with a hard-coded key in the resource.
Before 12 March 2020, NetWalker used the email contact process between its support operation and the victims to proceed with payment and send the decryption program.
To do this, NetWalker used its configuration file in the resource to set its encryption mode, the name of the ransom note, etc., and email contacts.

Once decrypted, the configuration file reveals several parameters, allowing us to understand how it works (how it constitutes the ransom note, the number of threads allocated for encryption, etc.
):
When Netwalker changed its contact mode and switched from email to the submission of the user key directly on the web portal of the group’s blog, the configuration file in the resource also changed.
We found changes in the configuration file, such as the disappearance of the contact “mail” and “crmask” fields (previously set as XXX@cock.li,XXX@tuta.io, etc., and .mailto[email].{ID}).
This field was replaced by “onion1” and “onion2”, and these fields are set with the NetWalker blog URL/payment page (hxxp://rnfdsgm<snip>drqqd.onion/).
We also noticed that the NetWalker developers complemented their “unlocker” field with some specific values (e.g.
“psexec.exe, system, forti*.exe, fmon.exe*, etc”).

Usually, attackers use RC_DATA or a malicious BITMAP.
The latter can, for example, be a regular Bitmap (open matrix image format used by Windows) that can be used by malware to execute code or as a payload dropper.
The image’s pixels are an actual binary representation of the payload.
This process can be summarized as Exe -> Resources -> BMP with embedded data in pixels fetched and decrypted by, e.g.
a DLL -> Payload), etc.
However, in this case, they use this special custom type to increase obfuscation.
The NetWalker developers chose custom types by using 1337 or 31337 structs, so the resource format does not change.
However, as we said, several values have changed or been replaced:
