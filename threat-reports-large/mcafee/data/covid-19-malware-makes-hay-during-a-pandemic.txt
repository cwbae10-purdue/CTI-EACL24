As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is no surprise that malware authors are exploiting the pandemic.
McAfee recently released blogs around Covid-19 related threats – Staying safe while working remotely, COVID-19 Threat Update Now Includes Blood for Sale and Transitioning to a Mass Remote Workforce.
The first discusses how attackers would like to leverage this pandemic as an opportunity to attack organizations, the second gives a preview of attackers playing on the fears of the general public grappling to get a hold of a cure, help manage this illness and stay safe while the third gives some direction to organizations on how to verify their security controls.
In this blog we continue to discuss COVID-19 themed attacks and how to stay vigilant.
The weeks of quarantine have forced individuals and organizations to quickly adapt to a work from home model.
A lot more time is spent indoors and online and there continues to be anxiety around when normalcy will be restored.
For now, we continue to deal with a barrage of news articles around the pandemic, managing supply and demand of household goods in stores and online, and a shortage of medical supplies such as preventative masks, gloves and sanitizer.
These are trying times for us and a feast for fear mongering malware criminals.
Over the last few months of 2020, McAfee researchers have been hard at work during this time to keep our customers safe by more directed monitoring and adaptation of our detection stack to better manage the COVID-19 threat landscape.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive report due to the scope of a continually evolving landscape for COVID-19; therefore, we cover a subset of threats directed towards malware, spam and malicious/scam URL campaigns.
This blog serves to remind customers to utilize the various levers present in our endpoint product and our expanded portfolio such as McAfee’s Unified Cloud Edge.
Please read our recommendation section and view our IOC section (partial IOC list based on this article), expert rules section (covers few tactics based on this article).
McAfee utilizes several internal and external sourcing techniques for malware harvesting including collaboration with other industry partners as part of the Cyber Threat Alliance.

Conclusion
The timeline below shows a subset of prevalent malware families observed in our spam traps with references to COVID-19/Coronavirus.
The malware shown in this timeline have been chosen due to their capacity for damage (such as ransomware) or their ability to propagate (Emotet for spam, or other worm like activities).
A weekly distribution of all known COVID related IOCs per week is shown below.
This section covers a subset of the Malware families included in the timeline above and shows the various IOCs that referenced the virus.
For a more comprehensive list of IOCs please refer to the IOC section.
The first threat we observed taking advantage of the pandemic was Ursnif.
Ursnif is a banking Trojan aimed to steal banking credentials and has been evolving to become more powerful.
Ursnif collects system activities of the victims, record keystrokes, as well as keep track of network traffic and browser activity.
We have observed Ursnif using the COVID-19 filename to entice users since January 2020.
On executing the VBS file it drops a dll in C:\Programdata\FxrPLxT.dll and executes the .dll with rundll32.exe.
The dll is injected into iexplorer.exe and communicates with its C&C server using http get requests.

MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
Fareit is an information stealer that steals data from web browsers, FTP programs, email clients and over a hundred different software tools installed on the infected machine.
We have observed several Fareit phishing emails with the COVID/Coronavirus name.
A few of them are shown below.

MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
It was no surprise that a new Ransomware family appeared on the scene.
Once executed, Ransomware-GVZ will delete shadow copies with vssadmin and then proceed to encrypt all non-pe file types.
Once a whole folder has been encrypted the ransom note file below is created.
Ransomware-GVZ will also create a lock screen component so that when the machine is rebooted the following message is displayed.

MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
Emotet is another prevalent threat distributed via phishing emails.
We observed the following email being distributed which translated to English is:
Subject:
Break !!!
COVID-19 solution announced by WHO at the end How a total control method is discovered
Email Body:
As published in the newsletter of the World Health Organization 3/17/2020 7:40:21 a.m. A new collaborative study identified and studied antibodies to the COVID-19 virus which could be used to design effective universal therapies against many different species of COVID-19 viruses.
The results have recently been published in Nature Microbiology.
These are based on natural activities and how heat helped inhibit the virus from growing.
The COVID-19 virus causes a serious disease with high mortality badgers in humans.
Several strategies have been developed to treat COVID-19 virus infection, including ZMapp, which has proven effective in non-human primates and has been used below compassionate treatment protocols in humans …
Please download the full text in the attached document …
Also share with all contacts to ensure quick epidermal control.
The email contains a zipped Emotet executable which once executed will use the process hollowing technique to inject into regasm.exe.
It will then contact its C&C server and being to send spam email out.

MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
Azorult is a malware that steals data from victim’s machine which includes username, passwords, cryptocurrencies, browsing history and cookies.
It also can download additional malware onto the victim’s machine.
What sets Azorult apart from the other Malware described in this report, is that the creators of Azorult created a fake Coronavirus infection map website (corona-virus-map.com).
The fake website appears as below:

MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
Another Ransomware which has leveraged COVID-19 is Netwalker.
The Ransomware used the filename “CORONAVIRUS_COVID-19.vbs” to trick users into executing it.
The VBS file contained the embedded Ransomware payload.
On execution of vbscript, the Ransomware is dropped in “C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Temp\qeSw.exe” and executes it.
It Deletes the shadow copies from the machine with vssadmin.exe to make file recovery more difficult.
Below shows the Obfuscated vbscript
The ransomware iterates through the folders of the infected machine and encrypts the files.
Once encrypted the file extension is changed to <filename>.1fd385.
A ransom note is also dropped in each folder where files were encrypted.
This note is shown below.

MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
NanoCore is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and its highly customizable plugins allows attackers to tailor its functionality to their needs.
This RAT is also found to be using COVID-19 to distribute itself by using email subjects such as “Covid-19 Urgent Precaution Measures”.
IOCs
MITRE ATT&CK™ MATRIX:
Hancitor trojan has also uses COVID–19 themes to spread itself by posing as an email from insurance company.
The email contains a link to download a fake invoice which downloads a VBS file.
On executing the VBS, the Hancitor dll temp_adobe_123452643.txt is created in the %AppData/Local/Temp folder.
The DLL is executed using the Regsvr32.exe and then begins to communicate with its C&C.
