We encountered the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub family for the first time in 2015, when the first versions of the malware were detected, analyzed, and found to be more adept at spying than stealing funds.
The Trojan has evolved since then, aided by a large-scale distribution campaign by its creators (in spring-summer 2017), helping Asacub to claim top spots in last year’s ranking by number of attacks among mobile banking Trojans, outperforming other families such as Svpeng and Faketoken.
We decided to take a peek under the hood of a modern member of the Asacub family.
Our eyes fell on the latest version of the Trojan, which is designed to steal money from owners of Android devices connected to the mobile banking service of one of Russia’s largest banks.
Sewn into the body of the Trojan is the version number, consisting of two or three digits separated by periods.
The numbering seems to have started anew after the version 9.
The name Asacub appeared with version 4 in late 2015; previous versions were known as Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Smaps.
Versions 5.X.X-8.X.X were active in 2016, and versions 9.X.X-1.X.X in 2017.
In 2018, the most actively distributed versions were 5.0.0 and 5.0.3.
Although Asacub’s capabilities gradually evolved, its network behavior and method of communication with the command-and-control (C&C) server changed little.
This strongly suggested that the banking Trojans, despite differing in terms of capability, belong to the same family.
Data was always sent to the C&C server via HTTP in the body of a POST request in encrypted form to the relative address /something/index.php.
In earlier versions, the something part of the relative path was a partially intelligible, yet random mix of words and short combinations of letters and numbers separated by an underscore, for example, “bee_bomb” or “my_te2_mms”.
Example of traffic from an early version of Asacub (2015)
The data transmitted and received is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm and encoded using the base64 standard.
The C&C address and the encryption key (one for different modifications in versions 4.x and 5.x, and distinct for different C&Cs in later versions) are stitched into the body of the Trojan.
In early versions of Asacub, .com, .biz, .info, .in, .pw were used as top-level domains.
In the 2016 version, the value of the User-Agent header changed, as did the method of generating the relative path in the URL: now the part before /index.php is a mix of a pronounceable (if not entirely meaningful) word and random letters and numbers, for example, “muromec280j9tqeyjy5sm1qy71” or “parabbelumf8jgybdd6w0qa0”.
Moreover, incoming traffic from the C&C server began to use gzip compression, and the top-level domain for all C&Cs was .com:
Since December 2016, the changes in C&C communication methods have affected only how the relative path in the URL is generated: the pronounceable word was replaced by a rather long random combination of letters and numbers, for example, “ozvi4malen7dwdh” or “f29u8oi77024clufhw1u5ws62”.
At the time of writing this article, no other significant changes in Asacub’s network behavior had been observed:
It is fairly safe to say that the Asacub family evolved from Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Smaps.
Communication between both Trojans and their C&C servers is based on the same principle, the relative addresses to which Trojans send network requests are generated in a similar manner, and the set of possible commands that the two Trojans can perform also overlaps.
What’s more, the numbering of Asacub versions is a continuation of the Smaps system.
The main difference is that Smaps transmits data as plain text, while Asacub encrypts data with the RC4 algorithm and then encodes it into base64 format.
Let’s compare examples of traffic from Smaps and Asacub — an initializing request to the C&C server with information about the infected device and a response from the server with a command for execution:
Smaps request
Asacub request
Decrypted data from Asacub traffic:
{“id”:”532bf15a-b784-47e5-92fa-72198a2929f5″,”type”:”get”,”info”:”imei:365548770159066, country:PL, cell:Tele2, android:4.2.2, model:GT-N5100, phonenumber:+486679225120, sim:6337076348906359089f, app:null, ver:5.0.2″}

A comparison can also be made of the format in which Asacub and Smaps forward incoming SMS (encoded with the base64 algorithm) from the device to the C&C server:
Smaps format
Asacub format
Decrypted data from Asacub traffic:
{“data”:”2015:10:14_02:41:15″,”id”:”532bf15a-b784-47e5-92fa-72198a2929f5″,”text”:”SSB0aG91Z2h0IHdlIGdvdCBwYXN0IHRoaXMhISBJJ20gbm90IGh1bmdyeSBhbmQgbmU=”,”number”:”1790″,”type”:”load”}
The banking Trojan is propagated via phishing SMS containing a link and an offer to view a photo or MMS.
The link points to a web page with a similar sentence and a button for downloading the APK file of the Trojan to the device.

Asacub masquerades under the guise of an MMS app or a client of a popular free ads service.
We came across the names Photo, Message, Avito Offer, and MMS Message.
App icons under which Asacub masks itself
The APK files of the Trojan are downloaded from sites such as mmsprivate.site, photolike.fun, you-foto.site, and mms4you.me under names in the format:
photo_[number]_img.apk,
mms_[number]_img.apk
avito_[number].apk,
mms.img_[number]_photo.apk,
mms[number]_photo.image.apk,
mms[number]_photo.img.apk,
mms.img.photo_[number].apk,
photo_[number]_obmen.img.apk.
For the Trojan to install, the user must allow installation of apps from unknown sources in the device settings.
During installation, depending on the version of the Trojan, Asacub prompts the user either for Device Administrator rights or for permission to use AccessibilityService.
After receiving the rights, it sets itself as the default SMS app and disappears from the device screen.
If the user ignores or rejects the request, the window reopens every few seconds.

After installation, the Trojan starts communicating with the cybercriminals’ C&C server.
All data is transmitted in JSON format (after decryption).
It includes information about the smartphone model, the OS version, the mobile operator, and the Trojan version.
Let’s take an in-depth look at Asacub 5.0.3, the most widespread version in 2018.
