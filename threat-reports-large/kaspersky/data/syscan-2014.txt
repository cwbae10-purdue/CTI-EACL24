In the first week of April 2014 we were at “The Symposium on Security for Asia Network” (SyScan), a “geeky” single-track conference located in Singapore.
I liked the friendly atmosphere from the very first slides of the event (as is seen above).
The program covered hardware and software attacks like “Car Hacking”, “Defeating SecureBoot”, “Point-of-Sale”-hacks (“Flappy Bird” injected on a mobile POS device was my favorite), “RFID”-hacks, “Anti-Virus Software” flaws, “Phone hacks”, “OS-Hacks” and a “Linux Memory Forensic” case study amongst others.
All of the presentations were of quite high quality in content and most of the speakers did a nice job presenting their content.
Much beer did flow at the “BarCon” at the end of day one …
Enjoying technical talks while sipping beer at the table – I love that idea :-).
On day two, we got used to the proper etiquette and started the beer flow a bit earlier.
What actually surprised me, was the quality of content which didn’t make it into the main program but was performed by people at the “Whiskey Con”, labelled “5 minutes (2 shots of whiskey) each Blabber”.
These guys were fun ^5 and gave the event a very nice and unique touch.
Finally, besides the good technical content and nice people, there were also plenty of opportunities for shopping around or enjoying some of Singapore’s vibrant night life.
Definitely a date to mark at next year’s event calendar, Thank you SyScan!
