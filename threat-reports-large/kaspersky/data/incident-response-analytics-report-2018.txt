This report covers our team’s incident response practices for the year 2018.
We have thoroughly analyzed all the service requests, customer conversations and incident response deliverables to provide you an overview in numbers.
The report includes statistics on how companies reveal data breaches and compromises, the attack vectors most commonly used by adversaries, how long they remain inside a company’s infrastructure and much more.
We also provide some high-level recommendations to improve resilience against such attacks.
The data used in this report comes from the wide range of incident investigation services provided by Kaspersky teams.
The main digital forensic and incident response operations unit is called the Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) and includes experts in Europe, Latin America, North America, Russia and the Middle East.
However, our operational coverage is much greater and that’s why our company focused many more resources on incident response and malware analysis activities.
An example of this is the advanced targeted attack investigations by the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT).
More than half of the requests for investigation were initiated by customers after detecting an attack that had visible consequences, such as unauthorized money transfers, workstations encrypted by ransomware, service unavailability, etc.
This indicates the need to improve attack detection methods and incident response procedures within a company to avoid financial losses and to minimize the impact of attacks on the company’s infrastructure.
It should be noted that in two out of three cases, investigation of incidents related to the detection of suspicious files or network activity revealed an actual attack on the customer’s infrastructure.
In the other cases, suspicious activity was caused by unusual user actions or software behavior related to security misconfigurations.
The most common reason for customer requests was a ransomware attack.
This category of attack is characterized by rapid development, difficulty of early detection, and contrastingly obvious consequences.
Experts from Kaspersky Anti-Malware Research Department ranked the most common types of ransomware which targeted organizations in 2018.
If a ransomware attack is detected, it is recommended to:
Isolate the host and the network segment where the incident took place to avoid further attack development.
Take snapshots of RAM and images of the hard drives for further detailed investigation.
Analyze encrypted files to determine the malware type.
This will help to promptly implement a set of initial response measures.
Conduct an investigation of the incident to determine the initial vector of attack and find possible backdoors to prevent recurrence of the incident.
Top 7 ransomware attacks by share of victims
Only 22% of companies where evidence of malicious activity was detected requested an Incident Response service.
Kaspersky customers often request detailed analysis of the data collected by automated monitoring tools.
As a result of analyzing this data, the following conclusions were reached:
81% of organizations that provided data for analysis were found to have indicators of malicious activity in their internal network.
One out of three organizations exhibited signs of an advanced targeted attack.
Attack trends and key security threats were identified for the following major sectors:
The remote management interface of the RDP service was used in the initial attack vector in one out of three incidents.
In the majority of cases, an adversary successfully obtained a valid user’s credentials as a result of a brute-force attack on the RDP service.
Such an attack usually lasted just a few hours because weak or dictionary passwords were used.
In addition, in most cases the same credentials were used for authentication in different systems, so an attacker was able to reuse the usernames and passwords to access additional hosts.
In one third of attacks through remote management interfaces, the valid credentials were known to the intruder in advance (no brute-force attempts were detected).
They were probably obtained using social engineering methods or were found on unsecured resources with public access (for example, if an employee used the same password to register on third party resources).
Recommendations:
Restrict access to any remote management interfaces from external IP addresses.
Remote control interfaces should be accessible only from a limited number of workstations.
Use third-party solutions to enforce encryption (IPsec, stunnel).
Enforce a strict password policy for all IT systems.
Avoid using high-privileged accounts wherever possible: follow the principle of least privilege.
Consider deployment of two-factor authentication.
33% of attacks occurred due to a lack of security awareness among employees.
An employee downloaded a malicious file from untrusted sources and launched it, allowing an adversary to gain control over the workstation.
While it is impossible to completely eliminate human error, regular staff training on information security awareness can significantly reduce the success of attacks using social engineering methods.
Recommendations:
Use endpoint protection software on every host in the LAN and ensure it is regularly updated.
Use a ‘sandbox’ for analysis of every file downloaded from external resources.
Increase security awareness among employees, management and IT staff.
This can be accomplished by regular security awareness sessions with periodic checks.
From a long-term perspective, the following strategies are recommended:
Implement patch management procedures that include centralized software updates on all hosts, including those that are not a part of the domain infrastructure.
Consider deploying a solution for network traffic analysis.
Automatically back up data to a device that is not writable thereafter.
Conduct regular security assessments of the IT infrastructure.
For a number of incidents, Kaspersky specialists have established the time period between the beginning of the attacker activity and the end of the attack.
After analysis, all incidents were divided into three categories of attack duration.
