Once again, we are happy to support a large, voluntary, collaborative effort like the 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report.
While our data contribution is completely anonymous, it is based in some of the 2018 data set that our private report customers receive from our efforts to protect all of our customers against every type of malware threat regardless of its source.
In general, the report is an excellent point of reference because it is sourced from so many organizations handling various incidents.
This year, the Public Administration sector tops the list by far in terms of reported incidents and data along with the Information sector.
“Cyber-Espionage is rampant in the Public sector, with State-affiliated actors accounting for 79 percent of all breaches involving external actors” and “Web applications are targeted with availability attacks as well as leveraged for access to cloud-based organizational email accounts.” Small businesses made up 43% of the reported DBIR breach victims in 2018.
“Use 2FA” is a common refrain throughout the report, along with “squish the phish”.
Both two factor authentication and phishing awareness, training, and handling can go a long ways toward improving security in all organizations.
Enjoy another fine read this year!
