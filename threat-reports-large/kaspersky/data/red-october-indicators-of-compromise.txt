Since our announcement about “Red October”, we’ve received a lot of questions on how to quickly identify compromised systems.
That’s why together with our partner Alienvault we’ve decided to put together a small whitepaper for CERTs and system administrators which can help identify and mitigate the attack.
The small whitepaper includes summarized information about malware’s known locations in infected systems, command and control domains and servers, snort rules, RC4 encryption keys, passwords and an industry standard IOC file with all these informations.
At the moment, our sinkhole is still registering traffic from 36 infected victims in several countries.
We hope the information will help CERTs and admins to successfully identify and eradicate the infections.
