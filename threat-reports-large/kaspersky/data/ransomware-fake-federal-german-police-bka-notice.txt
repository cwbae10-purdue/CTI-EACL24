Kaspersky Lab is still monitoring malicious websites involved in the recent Japan spam campaigns.
For those who may have missed the two first blogs, you can read them here and here However, today we discovered than some of the payloads were not the usual Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack.
*.
Instead, the payload is now Ransomware (detected as Trojan-Ransom.Win32.PornoBlocker.jtg), disguising itself as a fake warning message from the German Federal Police.
The message pretends that your computer has been blocked because it was found to be hosting child pornography.
Victims are asked to pay a 100 euros fine to unlock the machine.
As if the German police logo wasnâ€™t enough, they also use logo from anti-virus companies such as Kaspersky Lab to look more convincing.
On successful exploitation, the malware hijacks the desktop to display the following warning:
The victim can no longer use their computer, unless they pay a 100 euros ransom.
Here is a translation of the blackmail test:
Attention!

Federal Republic of Germany!
