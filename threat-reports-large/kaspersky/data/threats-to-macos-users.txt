The belief that there are no threats for the macOS operating system (or at least no serious threats) has been bandied about for decades.
The owners of MacBooks and iMacs are only rivaled by Linux users in terms of the level of confidence in their own security, and we must admit that they are right to a certain degree: compared to Windows-based systems, there are far fewer threats that target macOS.
However, the main reason for this is the number of potential victims: there are many more computers running Windows than those running macOS.
However, the situation is changing, since the popularity of the latter platform is growing.
Due to this and despite all the efforts that have been taken by the company, the threat landscape for Apple devices is changing, and the amount of malicious and unwanted software is growing.
For the purposes of this report we used the statistics from Kaspersky Security Network cloud infrastructure.
It stores information about all of the malicious programs and other threats that our macOS product users agreed to anonymously share with us.
In fact, all these threats at some point attacked the computers of Kaspersky security solution users, but these attacks were successfully repelled.
During the first half of 2019, we detected nearly 6 million phishing attacks on macOS users.
Of these, 11.80% targeted corporate users.
The countries with the largest share of unique macOS users who experienced phishing attacks were Brazil (30.87%), India (22.08%), and France (22.02%).
The number of phishing attacks that make use of the Apple brand name grows by 30–40% every year.
In 2018, the number of such attacks approached 1.5 million.
As of June, the number of phishing attacks in 2019 has already exceeded 1.6 million, which is an increase of 9% over the entire previous year.
From 2012 to 2017, the number of macOS users who have experienced attacks from malicious and potentially unwanted programs grew, approaching 255,000 attacked users per year.
However, starting in 2018, the number of attacked users began to decrease, and in the first half of 2019 it only amounted to 87,000.
The number of attacks on macOS users through malicious and potentially unwanted programs has been increasing annually since 2012, and in 2018 it exceeded 4 million attacks.
During the first half of 2019, we registered 1.8 million attacks of this kind.
The vast majority of threats for macOS in 2019 were in the AdWare category.
As for the malware threats, the Shlayer family, which masquerades as Adobe Flash Player or an update for it, has been the most prevalent.
More than a quarter of Mac users who are protected by Kaspersky solutions and have experience malicious and potentially unwanted software attacks live in the USA.
We started collecting detailed statistics on phishing threats that target macOS users in 2015.
The data that has been collected over the last four years suggests that the number of phishing attacks on macOS users is definitely growing, and quite rapidly at that.
While in 2015 we registered a total of 852,293 attacks, in 2016 this figure grew by 86% to over 1.5 million, and in 2017 it skyrocketed to 4 million.
In 2018, the number of attacks continued to grow, crossing the 7.3 million mark.
At this point we can see that during the first half of 2019 alone, 5,932,195 attacks were committed, which means that the number of attacks may exceed 16 million by the end of the year if the current trend continues.
Growth in the number of phishing attacks on macOS users, 2015–2019
The share of corporate macOS users who faced phishing attacks during the first half of 2019 came up to 11.80%.
This is a slight increase compared to the same period in 2018, when this category made up 10.25%.
In order to understand what services phishing pages impersonate, we analyzed the most common phishing tricks and the geography of attacked users.
Then we compared the results with the data from the same period of 2018.
Both in 2019 and 2018, the phishing pages visited by MacOS users most often pretended to be banking services (39.95% in 2019 and 29.68% in 2018), the second popular being global Internet portals (21.31% in 2019 and 27.04% in 2018).
Social networks came in third in 2019 (12.3%), taking up the online stores’ place (10.75% in 2018).
Phishing pages by share of users, first halves of 2018 and 2019
The countries with the largest share of unique macOS product users facing phishing attacks during the first half of 2019 were Brazil (30.87%), India (22.09%), and France (22.02%).
In 2018, the top three countries were the same as in 2019.
The only difference was in the percentages of users who were attacked: Kaspersky solutions prevented attacks against one out of four Mac product users in Brazil (26.02%), against one out of five in France (20.86%) and 17.70% in India.
Geography of phishing attacks by share of users, first halves of 2018 and 2019
Among the phishing attacks faced by macOS users we would separately focus on fake web pages that mimic Apple’s official pages or simply mention the brand.
Not so long ago, in 2016, there were relatively few attacks (755,000) that tried to take advantage of the brand.
But in 2017 they had grown by almost 40% to exceed 1 million, and a year later they almost reached 1.5 million.
We have every reason to believe that a new record will be set in 2019: during the first half of the year alone, our solutions prevented more than 1.6 million attacks, which means that by the end of the year we can expect at least twofold growth.
Number of phishing attacks using the Apple brand, 2016–2019
Let’s take a closer look at some examples of phishing pages that mimic the official Apple website.
Naturally, most commonly these phishing attacks aim to steal users’ Apple IDs.
