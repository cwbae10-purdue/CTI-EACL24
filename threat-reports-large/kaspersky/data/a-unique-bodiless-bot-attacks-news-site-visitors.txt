In early March, we received a report from an independent researcher on mass infections of computers on a corporate network after users had visited a number of well-known Russian online information resources.
The symptoms were the same in each case: the computer sent several network requests to third-party resources, after which, in some cases, several encrypted files appeared on the hard drive.
The infection mechanism used by this malware proved to be very difficult to identify.
The websites used to spread the infection are hosted on different platforms and have different architectures.
None of our attempts to reproduce the infections were successful.
A quick analysis of KSN statistics that might help to identify the connection between compromised resources and the malicious code being distributed did not yield any results, either.
However, we did manage to find something that the news sites had in common.
For purposes of analysis, we selected two information resources which we knew had been used to distribute the malwareâ€” http://www.ria.ru/ (a major Russian news agency) and http://www.gazeta.ru/ (a popular online newspaper).
Regularly saving the contents of these resources did not identify any third-party JS scripts occasionally showing up, iframe tags, 302 errors or any other formal attributes indicating that the resources have been compromised.
The only thing they had in common was that they both used AdFox advertisement management system codes, through which teaser exchange was arranged.
The code on the main page of RIA.ru that is used to download additional content from AdFox.ru
