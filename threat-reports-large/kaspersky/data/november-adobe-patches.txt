This month’s Adobe Security Update round is a relatively quiet one, in contrast to the Microsoft patch cycle.
There are two bulletins, one affecting Flash Player and one affecting ColdFusion.
After the discovery of a major breach at Adobe recently some would perhaps have expected a bigger number of CVEs to get patched this round.
It will be interesting to see how the breach will affect patch cycles in the coming months.
The two CVEs affecting Flash Player and Adobe AIR both involve remote code execution vulnerabilities.
Exploits for these vulnerabilities have so far not been observed in the wild.
But given the popularity and criticality it’s important to roll out the patches as soon as possible.
The two vulnerabilities affecting ColdFusion have to do with XSS and remote-read vulnerabilities respectively.
Just like with the Flash CVEs no exploits for these vulnerabilities have so far been seen in the wild.
For those with an Adobe ID – even if you didn’t receive an email from Adobe saying that your account credentials may have been compromised it’s still paramount that you change your password.
It should go without saying that if the same password was used for other services they need to be changed there as well.
