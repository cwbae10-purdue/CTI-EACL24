Transparent Tribe, also known as PROJECTM or MYTHIC LEOPARD, is a highly prolific group whose activities can be traced as far back as 2013.
In the last four years, this APT group has never taken time off.
They continue to hit their targets, which typically are Indian military and government personnel.
This is the second of two articles written to share the results of our recent investigations into Transparent Tribe.
In the previous article, we described the various Crimson RAT components and provided an overview of impacted users.
Here are some of the key insights that will be described in this part:
We found a new Android implant used by Transparent Tribe for spying on mobile devices.
It was distributed in India disguised as a porn-related app and a fake national COVID-19 tracking app.
New evidence confirms a link between ObliqueRAT and Transparent Tribe.
During our analysis, we found an interesting sample, which follows a variant of the previously described attack scheme.
Specifically, the attack starts with a simple document, which is not malicious by itself, does not contain any macro and does not try to download other malicious components, but it uses social engineering tricks to lure the victim into downloading other documents from the following external URLs:
hxxp://sharingmymedia.com/files/Criteria-of-Army-Officers.doc
hxxp://sharingmymedia.com/files/7All-Selected-list.xls
15DA10765B7BECFCCA3325A91D90DB37 – Special Benefits.docx
The remote files are two Microsoft Office documents with an embedded malicious VBA, which behaves similarly to those described in the previous article and drops the Crimson “Thin Client”.
The domain sharingmymedia.com was even more interesting: it was resolved with the IP 89.45.67.160 and was registered on 2020-01-10 using Namesilo and the following information:
Registrant Name: bluff hunnter Registrant Organization: Registrant Street: India Dehli Registrant City: Dehli Registrant State/Province: Delhi Registrant Postal Code: 110001 Registrant Country: IN Registrant Phone: +91.4214521212 Registrant Phone Ext: Registrant Fax: Registrant Fax Ext: Registrant Email: hunterbluff007@gmail.com
The same information was used to register another domain, sharemydrives.com, which was registered seven days before, on 2020-01-03, using Namesilo.
DNS resolution points to the same IP address: 89.45.67.160.
Using our Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal, we found the following related URL:

The file is a modified version of MxVideoPlayer, a simple open-source video player for Android, downloadable from GitHub and used by Transparent Tribe to drop and execute their Android RAT.

The dropper tries to find a list of legitimate packages on the system:
imo.android.imoim
snapchat.android
viber.voip
facebook.lite
If the device was produced by Xiaomi, it also checks if the com.truecaller package is present.
The code used to check if legitimate packages are installed
The first application on the list that is not installed on the system will be selected as the target application.
The malware embeds multiple APK files, which are stored in a directory named “assets”.
The analyzed sample includes the following packages:
apk a20fc273a49c3b882845ac8d6cc5beac
apk 53cd72147b0ef6bf6e64d266bf3ccafe
apk bae69f2ce9f002a11238dcf29101c14f
apk b8006e986453a6f25fd94db6b7114ac2
apk 4556ccecbf24b2e3e07d3856f42c7072
apk 6c3308cd8a060327d841626a677a0549
The selected APK is copied to /.System/APK/.
By default, the application tries to save the file to external storage, otherwise it saves it to the data directory.
Finally, the application tries to install the copied APK.
The final malware is a modified version of the AhMyth Android RAT, open-source malware downloadable from GitHub, which is built by binding the malicious payload inside other legitimate applications.
The original AhMyth RAT includes support for the following commands:
