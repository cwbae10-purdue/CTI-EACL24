This monthâ€™s patch Tuesday is a sizable one by any standards, following the quiet Tuesday that my colleague Roel Schouwenberg described last month.
Microsoft is patching a total of 34 vulnerabilities in 16 bulletins, MS11-038 through MS11-051.
At least eight different Microsoft product lines are updated, and Adobe is coordinating release of Reader, Acrobat, Shockwave and Flash updates as well today.
