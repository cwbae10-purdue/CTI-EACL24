Beginning in H2 2019 we have observed a tendency for decreases in the percentages of attacked computers, both in the ICS and in the corporate and personal environments.
In H1 2020 the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked has decreased by 6.6 percentage points to 32.6%.
The number was highest in Algeria (58.1%), and lowest in Switzerland (12.7%).
Despite the overall tendency for the percentages of attacked computers to decrease, we did see the number grow in the Oil & Gas sector by 1.6 p.p.
to 37.8% and by 1.9 p.p.
to 39.9 % for computers used in building automation systems.
These numbers are higher than the percentages around the world overall.

Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked (download)
Threats are becoming more targeted and more focused, and as a result, more varied and complex.
Kaspersky solutions in ICS environments blocked over 19.7 thousand malware modifications from 4,119 different families.
We are seeing noticeably more families of backdoors, spyware, Win32 exploits and malware built on the .Net platform.
Ransomware was blocked on 0.63% of ICS computers.
This is very similar to the total of 0.61% in H2 2019.
The internet, removable media and email continue to be the main sources of threats in the ICS environment.
Predictably, the percentages in the rankings for these threats have decreased.
Internet threats were blocked on 16.7% of ICS computers (-6.4 p.p.
).
Threats penetrating when removable media are connected were blocked on 5.8% of computers (-1.9 p.p.
).
Malicious email attachments were blocked on 3.4% of ICS computers (-1.1 p.p.
).
