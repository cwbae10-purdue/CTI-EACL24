In early October, it was announced that a critical vulnerability had been found in the libutils library.
The libutils library is part of Android OS; it implements various primitive elements that can be used by other applications.
The least harmful result that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to is the software that uses the stagefright library and handles MP3/MP4 files crashing.
