Yesterday, we read a blogpost about a new, fake security solution for mobile phones which fraudulently uses the Kaspersky Lab logo in order to better fool potential victims.
This is rather old news.
We have detected this fake AV since August 6 2008, as not-a-virus:FraudTool.J2ME.KaspAV.a.
Hereâ€™s a link to our blogpost from 2008, with a small video that shows how it works:
