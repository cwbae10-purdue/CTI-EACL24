The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region.
The Gaza cybergangâ€™s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats.
One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.
Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection.
Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated.
Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking different kinds of MENA intelligence.
Some of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang:
Gaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in government entities in MENA
New targets identified include oil and gas in MENA
New tools and techniques include
Abuse of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability
Usage of macros inside Microsoft Access files, enabling lower detection rates
Possible Android mobile malware being used by attackers
