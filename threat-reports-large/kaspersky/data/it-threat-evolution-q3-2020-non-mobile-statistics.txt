Q3 2020 saw many high-profile ransomware attacks on organizations in various fields: education, healthcare, governance, energy, finance, IT, telecommunications and many others.
Such cybercriminal activity is understandable: a successful attack on a major organization can command a ransom in the millions of dollars, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the typical sum for mass ransomware.
Campaigns of this type can be viewed as advanced persistent threats (APTs), and Kaspersky researchers detected the involvement of the Lazarus group in the distribution of one of these ransomware programs.
Distributors of these Trojans also began to cooperate with the aim of carrying out more effective and destructive attacks.
At the start of the quarter, word leaked out that Maze operators had joined forces with distributors of LockBit, and later RagnarLocker, to form a ransomware cartel.
The cybercriminals used shared infrastructure to publish stolen confidential data.
Also observed was the pooling of expertise in countering security solutions.
Of the more heartening events, Q3 will be remembered for the arrest of one of the operators of the GandCrab ransomware.
Law enforcement agencies in Belarus, Romania and the UK teamed up to catch the distributor of the malware, which had reportedly infected more than 1,000 computers.
In Q3 2020, we detected four new ransomware families and 6,720 new modifications of this malware type.

According to our statistics, vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Office suite continue to lead: in Q3, their share amounted to 71% of all identified vulnerabilities.
Users worldwide are in no rush to update the package, putting their computers at risk of infection.
Although our products protect against the exploitation of vulnerabilities, we strongly recommend the timely installation of patches, especially security updates.
First place in this category of vulnerabilities goes to CVE-2017-8570, which can embed a malicious script in an OLE object placed inside an Office document.
Almost on a par in terms of popularity is the vulnerability CVE-2017-11882, exploits for which use a stack overflow error in the Equation Editor component.
CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2018-0802 likewise remain popular.

Distribution of exploits used by cybercriminals, by type of attacked application, Q3 2020 (download)
The share of vulnerabilities in Internet browsers increased by 3 p.p.
this quarter to 15%.
One of the most-talked-about browser vulnerabilities was CVE-2020-1380 — a use-after-free error in the jscript9.dll library of the current version of the Internet Explorer 9+ scripting engine.
This same vulnerability was spotted in the Operation PowerFall targeted attack.
Also in Q3, researchers discovered the critical vulnerability CVE-2020-6492 in the WebGL component of Google Chrome.
Theoretically, it can be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of a program.
The similar vulnerability CVE-2020-6542 was later found in the same component.
Use-after-free vulnerabilities were detected in other components too: Task Scheduler (CVE-2020-6543), Media (CVE-2020-6544) and Audio (CVE-2020-6545).
In another browser, Mozilla Firefox, three critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2020-15675, CVE-2020-15674 and CVE-2020-15673, related to incorrect memory handling, were detected, also potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the system.
In the reporting quarter, the vulnerability CVE-2020-1464, used to bypass scans on malicious files delivered to user systems, was discovered in Microsoft Windows.
An error in the cryptographic code made it possible for an attacker to insert a malicious JAR archive inside a correctly signed MSI file, circumvent security mechanisms, and compromise the system.
Also detected were vulnerabilities that could potentially be used to compromise a system with different levels of privileges:
CVE-2020-1554, CVE-2020-1492, CVE-2020-1379, CVE-2020-1477 and CVE-2020-1525 in the Windows Media Foundation component;
CVE-2020-1046, detected in the .NET platform, can be used to run malicious code with administrator privileges;
CVE-2020-1472, a vulnerability in the code for processing Netlogon Remote Protocol requests that could allow an attacker to change any user credentials.
Among network-based attacks, those involving EternalBlue exploits and other vulnerabilities from the Shadow Brokers suite remain popular.
Also common are brute-force attacks on Remote Desktop Services and Microsoft SQL Server, and via the SMB protocol.
In addition, the already mentioned critical vulnerability CVE-2020-1472, also known as Zerologon, is network-based.
This error allows an intruder in the corporate network to impersonate any computer and change its password in Active Directory.
Perhaps this quarter’s most interesting find was EvilQuest, also known as Virus.OSX.ThifQseut.a.
It is a self-replicating piece of ransomware, that is, a full-fledged virus.
The last such malware for macOS was detected 13 years ago, since which time this class of threats has been considered irrelevant for this platform.

* Unique users who encountered this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS who were attacked.
Among the adware modules and their Trojan downloaders in the macOS threat rating for Q3 2020 was Hoax.OSX.Amc.d.
Known as Advanced Mac Cleaner, this is a typical representative of the class of programs that first intimidate the user with system errors or other issues on the computer, and then ask for money to fix them.

* Share of malware type in the total number of malicious programs downloaded to IoT devices following a successful attack.
The statistics in this section are based on Web Anti-Virus, which protects users when malicious objects are downloaded from malicious/infected web pages.
Cybercriminals create such sites on purpose; web resources with user-created content (for example, forums), as well as hacked legitimate resources, can be infected.
The following statistics show the distribution by country of the sources of Internet attacks blocked by Kaspersky products on user computers (web pages with redirects to exploits, sites containing exploits and other malicious programs, botnet C&C centers, etc.).
Any unique host could be the source of one or more web-based attacks.
To determine the geographical source of web-based attacks, domain names are matched against their actual domain IP addresses, and then the geographical location of a specific IP address (GEOIP) is established.
In Q3 2020, Kaspersky solutions blocked 1,416,295,227 attacks launched from online resources located across the globe.
456,573,467 unique URLs were recognized as malicious by Web Anti-Virus.
