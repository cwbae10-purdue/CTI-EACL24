Technology is what is saving us from a complete change in the way of life in a world of a raging pandemic.
It keeps the educational process going, relieves the shortage of human communication and helps us to live life as fully as possible given the isolation and social distancing.
Many adults, and children too, have come to realize that the computer is not just a means of entertainment, but an important tool for education, communication and personal growth.
In this article, we look at changes that occurred in children’s behavior on the Web over the past year and the pandemic period.
The report is based on statistics gathered by Kaspersky Safe Kids, a software solution that protects children from unwanted content on the Internet.
Kaspersky Safe Kids scans the contents of a Web page the child is trying to access.
If the site falls into one of fourteen undesirable categories, the module sends an alert to Kaspersky Security Network.
No user’s personal information is transmitted and neither is privacy compromised.
We will note two important points:
It is up to the parent to decide which content to block by tweaking the protective solution’s preferences.
But anonymous statistics are collected for all the 14 categories.
Data is harvested only from computers running Windows and macOS; no mobile statistics are provided in this report.
Kaspersky Safe Kids filters Web content according to the following categories:
Internet communication
Adult content
Alcohol, tobacco, narcotics
Violence
Weapons, explosives, pyrotechnics
Profanity
Gambling, lotteries, sweepstakes
Computer games
E-tailers, banks, and payment systems
Software, audio, video
Anonymous access systems
Job search
Religion, religious associations
News media
In this article, we will take a closer look at the most-visited categories for the past year.
We have combined the less popular ones into a separate category, with their share of alerts marked as “Other”.

It was followed by Internet Communications with 24.16 percent and Video Games with 15.98 percent.
Online stores were fourth in popularity with 11 percent and News were fifth with 5.54 percent.
Interestingly, Job Search sites with 0.89 percent attracted far more interest from teenagers than Adult Content with 0.74 percent.

Windows users spent more time watching videos, gaming and reading news than macOS users.
The latter preferred chatting and spent much more time shopping online.
That said, the adult content Windows users watched on the average more frequently during the year.

The pandemic forced kids to study at home, attending classes online, and we have seen how this affected their time at the computer.
They less frequently visited gaming sites starting at the beginning of the year, even when compared with the September 2019 low of 16.75 percent: the figure fell to 13.26 percent in May.
Meanwhile, Internet Communications showed a slight growth in April exceeding the October 2019 high by 0.85 p.p.
to reach 27.51 percent.
Children visited online stores the most in the October of 2019.
The category accounted for 16.93 percent of all alerts.
The popularity of online shopping has steadily decreased since then, dropping by 7.57 p.p.
to 9.3 percent by April, but May saw it rebound slightly.
Adult Content grew somewhat (by about 0.5 p.p.)
in winter, then returned to the summer 2019 levels (0.49 percent) in May.
The graph shows an abnormal drop in visits to Software, Audio, Video websites in October.
The most likely cause can be considered to be the new macOS version, Catalina, released on October 7.
Users who installed the update faced issues with streaming video on YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime and many other sites.
The issue affected not just the Safari browser, but Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox as well.
It was fixed in November, a fact that the statistics reflect.

Let us take a closer look at the most popular categories by region and by country to see if children’s preferences changed during the pandemic.
Software, Audio, Video has remained ahead of Internet Communications in recent years: kids have used Windows and macOS computers for watching videos and listening to music, but switched to mobile devices to chat.
The category has retained its popularity even through the lockdown and online studies.

We explained the decrease in the category’s share on macOS in the fall and winter with issues stemming from an operating system update.
As for the decline among Windows users around the same time, it was offset by increasing interest in other categories of sites, for instance, E-Commerce.
By the end of the reporting period, the share of Software, Audio, Video had increased among Windows users, whereas children using macOS began watching videos less frequently by May.
Kids in South Asia (India, Bangladesh) were most likely to spend their time watching videos and listening to music (46.16 percent).
It was followed by Africa with 44.75 percent and the CIS with 43.83 percent.

In Asia and South Asia, children who used macOS were more likely to consume audio and video content than those who used Windows.
In other regions, the category’s Windows share was higher than macOS.
In the CIS countries, children’s behavior was nearly identical on the two operating systems.
Interestingly, the distribution of countries where the share of Software, Audio, Video was the largest differs slightly from the regional breakdown.

We observe a pronounced growth from 17.87 percent in June 2019 to 36.63 percent in May 2020 on desktop computers and laptops running macOS.
October’s peak was due to a reduction in the share of Software, Audio, Video category following the macOS update.

Kids spent more times playing video games on Windows than macOS desktop computers and laptops.
This is due to the fact that most computer games are released for the Windows operating system.
However, by the end of the reporting period, macOS users’ interest in games had grown.

Kids all around the world started visiting gaming sites less frequently, though.
This can be explained by added activity in the form of school lessons, which relocated into the home due to the pandemic.
Interestingly, the share of Video Games began to decline among Windows users starting in the fall of 2019.
While North America, Europe and Oceania did not show increased activity in Internet Communications and Software, Audio, Video, these regions had the highest shares of Video Games activity.

The October 2019 peak, as we said earlier, was associated with a disruption in percentage shares across categories on all platforms due to a malfunction in the new macOS.
But, in November and December, kids’ interest in online shopping was also higher than in the other months.
Which is not surprising: November is the time of the Black Friday sales around the world, and December typically sees everyone busy picking Christmas and New Year’s presents.

The most visited sites in Germany were amazon.de, otto.de, ebay.com; in the UAE, amazon.ae, panemirates.com, amazon.com and luluhypermarket.com; and in Canada, amazon.ca, visions.ca and bestbuy.ca.
Not just adults, but kids, too, showed interest in news, especially in light of recent events.
The number of children’s visits to news websites grew around the world as coverage of the pandemic began.
The peak (7.26 percent) fell on March, when most children were switched to distance learning.

Interest in news peaked in the UK and in Italy at in February.
Think of the fact that the transition to distance learning in these two countries took place in late February, whereas Germany and France went through the transition in early March, and interest in news there peaked in March, too.
Kids were interested in adult content to a lesser extent.
According to the global statistics, the popularity of this category peaked in January 2020 (1.12 percent), followed by a decline to the annual average.

They were followed by children in Russia (1.06 percent) and France (0.95 percent).
Children in China were least likely to access Adult Content on desktop computers: 0.04 percent.
The world is witnessing an unprecedented demonstration of digital technology primarily helping children develop, rather than impede their development.
Online education, and communication with friends and relatives are all made possible only through technology developed in recent decades, which have become not just a day-to-day assistant, but a lifeline in times when leaving home and making personal contact can pose a health threat.
Data for recent months shows that children who are staying at home with constant access to the computer primarily chat and watch videos.
And those are not necessarily just entertaining videos: there might be educational content amid that stream of YouTube clips.
This year, we noticed an interesting trend: children who use different operating systems diverge in their online behaviors.
Kids who use macOS spend more time in online stores, show slightly more interest in adult content, chat more online and less frequently visit gaming sites.
Windows users show greater interest in games and news, and visit websites with video and audio content more frequently.
We have also learned that children, like adults, pay attention to the news when the situation in the world concerns them directly.
So, in the month when various countries were expecting to switch to distance learning, kids started to follow the situation closer by going to news sites.
Today’s children, who start interacting with technology at an early age, find moving all of their day-to-day activities online much easier than adults, and they are better adapted to situations where going outside could be life-threatening.
Adults tend to question certain online activity, such as communications, but in a world where it is the only safe means of social contact, comes the realization that there may be more to it!
