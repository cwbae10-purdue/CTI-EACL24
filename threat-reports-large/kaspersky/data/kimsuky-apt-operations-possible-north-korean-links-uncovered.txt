For several months, we have been monitoring an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign against South Korean think tanks.
There are multiple reasons why this campaign is extraordinary in its execution and logistics.
It all started one day when we encountered a somewhat unsophisticated spy program that communicated with its “master” via a public e-mail server.
This approach is rather inherent to many amateur virus-writers.
However, there were a few things that attracted our attention:
The public e-mail server in question was Bulgarian – mail.bg.
The compilation path string contained Korean hieroglyphs.
The complete path found in the malware presents some of the Korean strings:
D:\rsh\공격\UAC_dll(완성)\Release\test.pdb
The “rsh” word, by all appearances, means a shortening of “Remote Shell” and the Korean words can be translated in English as “attack” and “completion”, i.e.
:
D:\rsh\ATTACK\UAC_dll(COMPLETION)\Release\test.pdb
We managed to identify several targets.
Here are some of the organizations that the attackers were interested in targeting:
Some clues also suggest that computers belonging to “The supporters of Korean Unification”(http://www.unihope.kr/) are also compromised.
Among other organizations we counted, 11 are based in South Korea and two entities reside in China.
There are a lot of minimal malicious programs involved in this campaign but, strangely, they each implement a single spying function.
We were able to find basic libraries that are responsible for common communication with campaign master and additional modules performing the following functions:
Keystroke logging
Directory listing collection
HWP document theft
Remote control download and execution
Remote control access
Clues found by us make it possible to surmise North Korean origin of the attackers.
