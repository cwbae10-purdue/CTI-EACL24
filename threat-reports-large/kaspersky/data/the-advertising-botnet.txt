Bots belonging to the Artro botnet are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack, which has been around since early 2008.
However, a full description of its functionality is still not available, so to rectify this, we decided to publish the results of a study we undertook.
The Artro botnet was created using a Trojan downloader that is detected by Kaspersky Lab as Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack.
The Trojan is protected by a packer with heavily obfuscated code.
As a rule, packers are used to prevent the detection of a packed malicious program rather than to protect its code from analysis, and this piece of malware is no exception: unpacking it is a relatively easy task.
When unpacked, the WinMain function of different Trojans usually looks more or less the same.
In this case, however, the malware authors tried to obfuscate their code by inserting large numbers of superfluous instructions in order to make the code harder to analyze.
The WinMain function of Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack after unpacking
The superfluous code is polymorphic and consists of code blocks that perform various operations on global variables which are not used by the main code.
It also includes API functions, which when executed, in no way affect the running of the program itself.
Superfluous instructions in a fragment of the Trojan’s disassembled code
Obfuscation produces code that is remarkably jumbled up for a simple downloader.
Notable features of Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack include checking that the Trojan is not running on a virtual machine or under a debugger.
However, unlike most malicious programs which terminate upon detecting a debugger or virtual machine in order to hinder dynamic analysis, CodecPack simply sends the results of the check to the C&C server.
Each string of the Trojan is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm and decrypted every time it needs to be used.
The first one or two bytes in each string contain the decryption key.
The length of the string is calculated by adding a constant to the key value -the constant being embedded in the Trojan’s code and unique for each sample.
The first thing Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack does upon launching is check for an Internet connection by sending DNS requests to several popular websites, such as wordpress.com, walmart.com and photobucket.com, which are likely to be available at any time of the day or night.
If there is no Internet connection, CodecPack terminates its process.
If the infected computer is online, the downloader collects information about it, including the volume serial number of the drive containing the Windows folder, operating system version, whether the current user has administrator privileges and whether the Trojan is running on a virtual machine or under a debugger.
Next, a request to the C&C center containing the collected data is created.
It is worth noting that the domains to which the downloader sends requests are not real C&C centers.
The servers associated with these domains are simply reverse proxies which are only needed to conceal the botnet’s real command-and-control center.
A POST request from the downloader to the C&C center and the reply received
Importantly, all the requests sent to command servers by the Trojan are encrypted.
The data is first encrypted using the RC4 algorithm and then encoded using Base64.
Replies from the C&C center are also encrypted.
The procedure for decrypting replies is the reverse of that used to encrypt requests: firstly, a reply is decoded using the Base64 algorithm and then it is decrypted using RC4.
The key used to encrypt and decrypt data is the same for all samples and is embedded in the Trojan’s body.
A request to the C&C center is a POST request with an ini parameter that contains a string:
v22MnmDnHYfxCWI06FcUQOE5OLPvIYg4OtcPHid3L0oHCw7U2UWOm2rzU1rHIQqMgMqVv8JHeAiBMF4QB33zfYiRtufQpKX8MPtpuO7vlA==
…which produces the following string when decrypted:
a1=4ded23cdfec1eb7b512840cadb35a169ddfc4eef&a2=00001920&cd=Fri 04 2011,22:16:41
The string includes the Trojan’s unique identifier (parameter a1), an identifier of the partner through which CodecPack was downloaded to the machine (parameter a2), and a time stamp that is included in the file as a string (parameter cd).
The data parameter contains a string:
qSrTzGL0RMCyDnY9+xJEQe5nNLundsMqfdgBGzUoJ0xVTU/DzQWC3DLbXB/UfETT1o6F2ZIbLEGVJ0MOJTSDP9PX4aSS/OagY6143bGp0y/uGVSLVL0u+us+x5NraqI7DJaKGg7TCqXkTszGInUBxiK1/hKL2oFYpjsSeY04x+zt2a9dO+UI5VhP0W45
…which looked like this before encryption:
wvbffv=updpov&admin=yes&wloapl=gcpxsp&os=Microsoft Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 (build 2600)&qymxsz=mkgflj&debug=none&oeuprp=cbvhox
This string provides the following information to the C&C center:
whether the user account under which the Trojan is running has administrator privileges (the value of the admin parameter can be “yes” or “no”) whether the Trojan is running under a debugger or on a virtual machine (the debug parameter can take the following values: “none”, “vmware”, “vmware2”, “vmware3”, “msvpc”, “msvpc2”, “cvpc”, “debugger1”, “debugger2”, “debugger3”, “debugger4”, “debugger5”, “softice”, “vm”, “vm2”) the version of the operating system (the OS parameter)
whether the Trojan is running under a debugger or on a virtual machine (the debug parameter can take the following values: “none”, “vmware”, “vmware2”, “vmware3”, “msvpc”, “msvpc2”, “cvpc”, “debugger1”, “debugger2”, “debugger3”, “debugger4”, “debugger5”, “softice”, “vm”, “vm2”) the version of the operating system (the OS parameter)
the version of the operating system (the OS parameter)
The purpose of the request is to receive a configuration file from the command server.
The file is sent by the server as a meaningless set of characters:
