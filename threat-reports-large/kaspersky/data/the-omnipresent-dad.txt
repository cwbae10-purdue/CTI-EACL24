Many websites show different text depending on where the user lives.
For instance, home pages of some portals show you the news and weather of your region by default, because you are most likely to be interested in this kind of information first of all.
Of course, spammers and fraudsters also make use of this approach.

The attached link directs users to times-financials.com, registered in October 2013, according to the information on whois:

The link for these pages is one and the same and leads to yourbinarysystem.com, registered in January 2014.
The site promises users wealth beyond their dreams, and yet another link directs to a third site with a standard pyramid scheme.
We haven’t received any letters with links to this ‘dad’ in any other language, except for Spanish.
However, we are pretty sure the creators of the pyramid scheme are also sending out letters in other languages to attract attention to their website.
