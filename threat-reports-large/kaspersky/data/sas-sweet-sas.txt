As you may already know from our social network posts, we have rescheduled the SAS 2020 conference for November 18-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure your safety.
Though we still think that Barcelona is a great place to meet and it will not be a “real” SAS if we cannot hug, shake hands and touch beer glasses in that beautiful city, we cannot just leave it all until November.
That is why we invite you to SAS at Home, a series of webinars scheduled to kick off very soon, on the 28th-30th of April.
For each of the three days, we have prepared presentations and master classes by world-renowned information security experts, who will share their expertise, best practice and tricks.
We will be talking about APT groups, zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits, sophisticated attacks, and the state of the information security industry.
As for master classes, Igor Kuznetsov will cover some of the most useful techniques for reverse engineering malware during his webinar, Static Binary Analysis: The Essentials.
And that is just one example.
Last but not least, Eugene Kaspersky himself will deliver a keynote address in the good old SAS tradition.

Do not miss your chance to spend your self-isolation days as usefully as possible and meet the world’s top information security experts, even if not in person.
See you all at SAS at Home!
