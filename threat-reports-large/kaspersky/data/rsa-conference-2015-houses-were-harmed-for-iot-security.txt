The RSA Conference 2015 is being held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
It a massive event, with thousands of people in attendance.
A huge number of booths built up by vendors provide coffee bars, presentations, and swag giveaways.
Threat intelligence is hawked by many here.
But, some of the most surprising parts of cyber-security that has been a long time coming is a discussion I do not always hear – cyber-security insurance and quantification methodologies of threat risk assessment.
Yawn.
This arrival following the massive 2014 data breaches, of course, is partly expected and a double edged sword.
It both incentivizes corporate decision makers to act more irresponsible with protecting your data (just buy more insurance to cover it, it’s cheap!
), and the policies may incentivize decision makers to strengthen their organization’s cybersecurity in order to meet coverage requirements.
Either way, carriers are underwriting more cybersecurity policies and we have yet to see the real impact.
From Kaspersky Lab, our very own David Jacoby will be presenting later today on IoT security at 10:20 am, West Moscone Room 3018.
Come check it out!
