Kaspersky Lab would like to alert users in the Middle East for new malware attacks being delivered through Syrian news and social networking forums.
Malware writers are using multiple techniques to deliver their files and entice the victims to run them, creating an effective infection vector.
Mainly depending on social engineering, the attackers exploit Victims’ trust in social networking forums, curiosity in following news related to the conflict in Syria, their standing in Syria, in addition to their lack of Cyber Security awareness.
Once criminals infect the victim’s computer, attackers have full access and control over victim’s devices.
In the first report on Syrian malware, Kaspersky Lab detailed many attacks being used in Syria to spy on users, the report included attacks from different teams and many sources.
This post will follow up on one of the domains, seemingly the most active in the last period: thejoe.publicvm.com
The malware files were found on activist sites and social networking forums, some others were reported by regional organisations like CyberArabs.
Reports that mention “the Joe” https://citizenlab.org/2013/06/a-call-to-harm/ https://www.eff.org/files/2013/12/28/quantum_of_surveillance4d.pdf
All the files hide under the hood a full-featured variant of a RAT, Remote Administration Trojan (Bitfrose/NjRAT/Shadowtech/Darkcomet…), capable of getting full control over victim machines and devices, monitoring any movements and accessing all files.
The thejoe.publicvm.com domain is related to many samples, here we will focus on the most important and luring, that most probably collected the highest number of targeted victims, estimated in thousands.
There are many factors and entities at play in this event, we will only focus on the malware and the facts that have been found during the analysis, presenting only relevant information, in the hope of setting a clear context for this research.
What is the information we had on theJoe?
What has the Joe been doing in the last period?
Who is the Joe?
The Joe is one of the most active cyber criminals in Syria and the Middle East, targeting all types of users, following is the information collected on the Joe and his activities.
The Joe is using a dynamic domain to be able to change his IP address and maintain anonymity: The domain thejoe.publicvm.com has been seen using the following IP addresses located in Syria and Russia:
31.9.48.146
31.9.48.119
31.9.48.146
31.9.48.80
31.9.48.78
31.9.48.119
31.8.48.7
TCP ports used in the attacks: 1234, 1177, 5522.
From the malware samples collected, we were able to find strings in the code, from the Windows device used by the Joe.
Folder paths recovered from the malware files:
C:UsersjoeDesktop2014WindowsApplication1WindowsApplication1objDebugWindowsApplication1.pdb
C:UsersjoeDesktopDesktopSyriatelSyriatelobjDebugSyriatel.pdb
C:UsersjoeDesktopNJServerNJServerobjDebugNJServer.pdb
The Joe is also using a fake youtube channel where he posts social engineering videos with links to download malware.

The Channel is distributing malware files under the name “Lions of the revolution” or other…
The Joe was busy in the last period; In the below we display some of the most graphical and luring samples collected by the Kaspersky Intelligence services and the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN cloud), detailing their functionalities and how The Joe is able to use the situation in Syria to have the users automatically open the files even if they suspect infected.
The most targeted countries are Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.
The number of victims is estimated around 2000.

One of the latest files used to infect users is quite different: a binding of a Kaspersky Lab tool with malware.
Developed by Kaspersky Lab, TDSSKiller is a powerful free tool that can detect and remove a specific list of rootkit malware families.
Bound with malware, the Joe is using the Kaspersky name to deliver the malware in an attempt to lure victims to open and trust the files he is sending.
Hundreds of samples were analyzed relating to the Syrian malware, one of the samples, extracts to multiple documents, in one of which, we were able to find a metadata slip which extracted to some interesting information.
The metadata slip by the guy using “Joe” as his nickname, revealed his personal email, which using further research leads to his other emails, full identity, social pages…
Kaspersky Lab detects all malicious files used in the attacks.
All files are actively being used by the cybercriminals at the time of this report.
Syrian malware has a strong reliance on social engineering and the active development of malicious variants.
Nevertheless, most of them quickly reveal their true nature when inspected carefully; and this is one of the main reasons for urging Syrian users to be extra vigilant about what they download and to implement a layered defense approach.
We expect these attacks to evolve both in quality and quantity.
