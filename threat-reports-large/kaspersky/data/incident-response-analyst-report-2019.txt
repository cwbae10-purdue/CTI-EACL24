As an incident response service provider, Kaspersky delivers a global service that results in global visibility of adversaries’ cyber-incident tactics and techniques used in the wild.
In this report, we share our teams’ conclusions and analysis based on incident responses and statistics from 2019.
As well as a range of highlights, this report will cover the affected industries, the most widespread attack tactics and techniques, how long it took to detect and stop adversaries after initial entry and the most exploited vulnerabilities.
The report also provides some high-level recommendations on how to increase resilience to attacks.
The insights used in this report come from incident investigations by Kaspersky teams from around the world.
The main digital forensic and incident response operations unit is called the Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) and includes experts in Europe, Latin America, North America, Russia and the Middle East.
The work of the Computer Incidents Investigation Unit (CIIU) and the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) are also included in this report.
In 2019, we noticed greater commitment among victims to understand the root causes of cyberattacks and improve the level of cybersecurity within their environments to reduce the probability of similar attacks taking place again in the future.
Analysis showed that less than a quarter of received requests turned out to be false positives, mostly after security tools issued alerts about suspicious files or activity.
The majority of true positive incidents were triggered by the discovery of suspicious files, followed by encrypted files, suspicious activity and alerts from security tools.
Most of the incident handling requests were received from the Middle East, Europe, the CIS and Latin America, from a wide spectrum of business sectors, including industrial, financial, government, telecoms, transportation and healthcare.
Industrial businesses were the most affected by cyberattacks, with oil and gas companies leading the way.
They were followed by financial institutions, dominated by banks, which bore the brunt of all money theft incidents in 2019.
Ransomware’s presence continued in 2019 and was felt most by government bodies, telecoms and IT companies in various regions.
Adversaries used a variety of initial vectors to compromise victims’ environments.
Initial vectors included exploitation, misconfiguration, insiders, leaked credentials and malicious removable media.
But the most common were exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, malicious emails, followed by brute-force attacks.
In addition to exploiting vulnerabilities, adversaries used several legitimate tools in different attack phases.
This made attacks harder to discover and allowed the adversaries to keep a low profile until their goals were achieved.
Most of the legitimate tools were used for credential harvesting from live systems, evading security, network discovery and unloading security solutions.
Although we started working on incidents the first day of a request in 70% of cases, analysis revealed that the time between attack success and its discovery varies between an average of one day in ransomware incidents to 10 days in cases of financial theft, up to 122 days in cyber-espionage and data-theft operations.
Based on 2019 incident response insights, applying the following recommendations can help protect businesses from falling victim to similar attacks:
Apply complex password policies
Avoid management interfaces exposed to the internet
Only allow remote access for necessary external services with multi-factor authentication – with necessary privileges only
Regular system audits to identify vulnerable services and misconfigurations
Continually tune security tools to avoid false positives
Apply powerful audit policy with log retention period of at least six months
Monitor and investigate all alerts generated by security tools
Patch your publicly available services immediately
Enhance your email protection and employee awareness
Forbid use of PsExec to simplify security operations
Threat hunting with rich telemetry, specifically deep tracing of PowerShell to detect attacks
Quickly engage security operations after discovering incidents to reduce potential damage and/or data loss
Back up your data frequently and on separated infrastructure
Significant effects on infrastructure, such as encrypted assets, money loss, data leakage or suspicious emails, led to 30% of requests for investigations.
More than 50% of requests came as a result of alerts in security toolstacks: endpoint (EPP, EDR), network (NTA) and others (FW, IDS/IPS, etc.
).
Organizations often only become aware of an incident after a noticeable impact, even when standard security toolstacks have already produced alerts identifying some aspects of the attack.
Lack of security operations staff is the most common reason for missing these indicators.
Suspicious files identified by security operations and suspicious endpoint activity led to the discovery of an incident in 75% of cases, while suspicious network activities in 60% of cases were false positives.
One of the most common reasons for an incident response service request is a ransomware attack: a challenge even for mature security operations.
For more details on types of ransomware and how to combat it, view our story “Cities under ransomware siege“.
A suspicious file is the most prevalent reason to engage incident response services.
This shows that file-oriented detection is the most popular approach in many organizations.
The distribution also shows that 100% of cases involving financial cybercrime and data leakage that we investigated occurred in CIS countries.
Although, different industries suffered from different incidents, 100% of money theft incidents occurred inside the financial industry (banks).
Detection of ransomware once the repercussions had been felt occurred primarily within the government, telecom and IT sectors.
Common initial vectors include the exploitation of vulnerabilities (0- and 1-day), malicious emails and brute-force attacks.
Patch management for 1-day vulnerabilities and applying password policies (or not using management interfaces on the internet) are well suited to address most cases.
0-day vulnerabilities and social engineering attacks via email are much harder to address and require a decent level of maturity from internal security operations.
By linking the popular initial compromise vectors with how an incident was detected, we can see detected suspicious files were detected from malicious emails.
And cases detected after file encryption mostly took place after brute-force or vulnerability exploitation attacks.
Sometimes we act as complimentary experts for a primary incident response team from the victim’s organization and we have no information on all of their findings – hence the ‘Unknown reasons’ on the charts.
Malicious emails are most likely to be detected by a variety of security toolstack, but that’s not showing distrubution of 0- to 1-day vulnerabilities.
The distribution of how long an attack went unnoticed and how an organization was compromised shows that cases that begin with vulnerability exploitation on an organization’s network perimeter went unnoticed for longest.
Social enginnering attacks via email were the most short-lived.
In cyberattacks, adversaries use legitimate tools which can’t be detected as malicious utilities as they are often used in everyday activities.
Suspicious events that blend with normal activity can be identified after deep analysis of a malicious attack and connecting the use of such tools to the incident.
The top used tools are PowerShell, PsExec, SoftPerfect Network Scanner and ProcDump.
Most legitimate tools are used for harvesting credentials from memory, evading security mechanisms by unloading security solutions and for discovering services in the network.
PowerShell can be used virtually for any task.
Let’s weight those tools based on occurrence in incidents – we will also see tactics (MITRE ATT&CK) where they are usually applied.
Most of the identified exploits in incident cases appeared in 2019 along with a well-known remote code execution vulnerability in Windows SMB service (MS17-010) being actively exploited by a large number of adversaries.
For a number of incidents, Kaspersky specialists have established the time period between the beginning of an adversary’s activity and the end of the attack.
As a result of the subsequent analysis, all incidents were divided into three categories of attack duration.
