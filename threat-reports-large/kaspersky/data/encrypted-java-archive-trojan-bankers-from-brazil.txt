I have never bought a PlayStation and neither has my colleague Micha-san from Japan – well, in his case, at least not from Brazil.
Nonetheless, we both received the same email notification:
In this instance cybercriminals from Brazil have used a new, yet very strange technique – spreading Trojan bankers via .Jar files.
I say strange because even if you just click on a .jar file, it won’t run unless you type “java -jar filename.jar” in the console; however this did not stop Brazilian cybercriminals and they even managed to spoof our email traps in Japan!
Let’s take a look inside one such Brazilian Java Archive banker.
The very first detection on VT 2014-02-01 13:18:57 0/50
After uncompressing and then disassembling, you will see the code encrypted with a substation cipher.
This is how the code looks like before it’s decrypted:
The substation cypher routine is embedded into the code and this is an example of how it works:
The complete table of substituted chars is this:
After decryption, the same code looks like this:
This small 14Kb .jar banker works as a downloader and is detected by Kaspersky Anti-Virus as Trojan.Java.Agent.da
Once it infects a victim’s machine, it creates a fake Google Chrome folder where it stores the newly downloaded banker from the mentioned URL.
It also sends the victim’s PC information to a remote server, which is already down.
Why have cybercriminals from Brazil now switched from Delphi to Java?
Perhaps this is a new generation of cybercriminals who no longer receive Delphi classes.
