It is a well-known fact that events of global interest are exploited by cybercriminals for financial gain.
Natural disasters in the past like the earthquake in Haiti, hurricane Katrina or the earthquake in New Zealand a few weeks ago are proof of this.
The current situation in Japan is no exception.
Such cases are a golden opportunity for cybercriminals and cybervandals whose main aim is to make a profit, even if it means exploiting other people’s misery.
There are lots of ways you can make donations to help the people of Japan, but the sheer number of charity organisations and campaigns can confuse those who want to donate.
What is more, it’s not always clear whether the people behind these campaigns can be trusted.
The same goes for the overwhelming flood of information and news in such situations.
Nowadays, we have the traditional mass media – TV stations, radio and newspapers – as well as lots of websites, blogs, video portals and social media sites which promise news in real time.
This variety plays into the hands of cybercriminals.
The quality of the scams that accompany such events is steadily increasing, which makes it more and more difficult to determine how trustworthy they are.
The criminals use modern media and social engineering in particular to lure victims into their scams.
They’re mostly manipulating human emotions:
Charity, to donate money Sensationalism Exploiting a desire to help the victims Causing panic
Sensationalism Exploiting a desire to help the victims Causing panic
Exploiting a desire to help the victims Causing panic
Causing panic
In the case of Japan the cybercriminals pulled out all the stops.
It is over a month since a major earthquake and tsunami struck on 11 March – time to review the most important events from a security perspective.
