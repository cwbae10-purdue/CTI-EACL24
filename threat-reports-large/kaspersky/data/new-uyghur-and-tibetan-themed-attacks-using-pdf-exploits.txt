On Feb 12th 2013, FireEye announced the discovery of an Adobe Reader 0-day exploit which is used to drop a previously unknown, advanced piece of malware.
We called this new malware “ItaDuke” because it reminded us of Duqu and because of the ancient Italian comments in the shellcode copied from Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy”.
Previously, we posted about another campaign hitting Governments and other institutions, named Miniduke, which was also using the same “Divine Comedy” PDF exploits.
In the meantime, we’ve come by other attacks which piggyback on the same high level exploit code, only this time the targets are different: Uyghur activists.
Together with our partner at AlienVault Labs, we analyzed these new exploits.

A few days ago, we observed several PDF files which carry the CVE-2013-0640/641 (ItaDuke) exploits.
Some of the MD5s and filenames include:
