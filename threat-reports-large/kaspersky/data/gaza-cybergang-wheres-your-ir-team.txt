Gaza cybergang is a politically motivated Arabic cybercriminal group operating in the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region, targeting mainly Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.
The group has been operating since 2012 and became particularly active in Q2 2015.
One interesting new fact about Gaza cybergang activities is that they are actively sending malware files to IT (Information Technology) and IR (Incident Response) staff; this is also obvious from the file names they are sending to victims, which reflect the IT functions or IR tools used in cyber attack investigations.
IT people are known for having more access and permissions inside their organizations than other employees, mainly because they need to manage and operate the infrastructure.
This is why getting access to their devices could be worth a lot more than for a normal user.
IR people are also known for having access to sensitive data related to ongoing cyber investigations in their organizations, in addition to special access and permissions enabling them to hunt for malicious or suspicious activities on the network…
The main infection modules used by this group are pretty common RATs: XtremeRAT and PoisonIvy
Some more interesting facts about Gaza cybergang:
Attackers take an interest in government entities, especially embassies, where security measures and IT operations might not be well established and reliable
Use of special file names, content and domain names (e.g.
gov.uae.kim), has helped the group perform better social engineering to infect targets
Increasing interest in targeting IT and IR people, which is clear from most of the recent malware file names used
Other operation names:
DownExecute
MoleRATs
Kaspersky Lab products and services successfully detect and block attacks by Gaza team.
