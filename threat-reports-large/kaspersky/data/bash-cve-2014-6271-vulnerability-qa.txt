The “bash” vulnerability, actually described as CVE-2014-6271, is an extremely powerful vulnerability due to its high impact and the ease with which it can be exploited.
An attacker can simply execute system level commands, with the same privileges as the affected services.
In most of the examples on the Internet right now, attackers are remotely attacking web servers hosting CGI scripts that have been written in bash.
At the time of writing, the vulnerability has already been used for malicious intentions – infecting vulnerable web servers with malware, and also in hacker attacks.
Our researchers are constantly gathering new samples and indications of infections based on this vulnerability; and more information about this malware will be published soon.
The key thing to understand is that the vulnerability is not bound to a specific service, for example Apache or nginx.
Rather, the vulnerability lies in the bash shell interpreter and allows an attacker to append system level commands to the bash environment variables.
I will use the same examples that we have seen in the advisories and proof-of-concept code that have been published,to explain how it works.
When you have a CGI script on a web server, this script automatically reads certain environment variables, for example your IP address, your browser version, and information about the local system.
But just imagine that you could not only pass this normal system information to the CGI script, but could also tell the script to execute system level commands.
This would mean that – without having any credentials to the webserver – as soon as you access the CGI script it would read your environment variables; and if these environment variables contain the exploit string, the script would also execute the command that you have specified.
This vulnerability is unique, because it’s extremely easy to exploit and the impact is incredible severe – not least because of the amount of vulnerable targets.
This does not just affect web servers, it affects any software which uses the bash interpreter and reads data which you can control.
Researchers are also trying to figure out if other interpreters, such as PHP, JSP, Python or Perl, are also affected.
Ddepending on how code is written, sometimes an interpreter actually uses bash to execute certain functions; and if this is the case, it might be that other interpreters could also be used to exploit the CVE-2014-6271 vulnerability.
The impact is incredibly high because there are a lot of embedded devices that use CGI scripts – for example routers, home appliances and wireless access points.
They are also vulnerable and, in many cases, difficult to patch.
This is very difficult to say, but we know from our intelligence systems that people started to develop exploits and worms directly after the vulnerability information was published – both whitehat and blackhat researchers are scanning the Internet for vulnerable servers.
It is too early to know how widespread this is, but I know from my own research that there are a great many web servers running CGI scripts, and I am pretty sure that we will also see a lot of other types of exploits being developed that target local files and network daemons.
There have been discussions regarding both OpenSSH and dhcp-clients being vulnerable to this attack as well.
The easiest way to check if your system is vulnerable is to open a bash-shell on your system and execute the following command:
