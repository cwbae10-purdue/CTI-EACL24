Isn’t it great when your forecasts come true?
Well, sometimes.
But maybe not this time.
Today I found a malicious site specially designed to fake three antivirus brands.
Kaspersky is top of the list.
So, what does it look like?
In the past we’ve seen Rogue AV websites using fake screenshots made with templates but without any real interaction with the user PC.
These fakes didn’t claim to find any infections – the victim was simply ripped off after paying for a useless product.
Now, though, we’ve found a new version where the Fake AV simulates the results of a malware search.
So, how does the infection happen?
There is a dropper (Trojan.Win32.Scar.fdiz) which downloads the Fake GUI required by the scam.
The query is built with this rule:
