Duqu 2.0: Frequently Asked Questions Duqu 2.0 Technical Paper (PDF) Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Yara rules Press release
Earlier this year, during a security sweep, Kaspersky Lab detected a cyber-intrusion affecting several of our internal systems.
Following this finding, we launched a large scale investigation, which led to the discovery of a new malware platform from one of the most skilled, mysterious and powerful groups in the APT world – Duqu.
The Duqu threat actor went dark in 2012 and was believed to have stopped working on this project – until now.
Our technical analysis indicates the new round of attacks include an updated version of the infamous 2011 Duqu malware, sometimes referred to as the stepbrother of Stuxnet.
We named this new malware and its associated platform “Duqu 2.0”.
Some of the new 2014-2015 Duqu infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues related to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal.
The threat actor behind Duqu appears to have launched attacks at the venues for some of these high level talks.
In addition to the P5+1 events, the Duqu 2.0 group has launched a similar attack in relation to the 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.
In the case of Kaspersky Lab, the attack took advantage of a zero-day in the Windows Kernel, and possibly up to two other, currently patched vulnerabilities, which were zero-day at that time.
The analysis of the attack revealed that the main goal of the attackers was to spy on Kaspersky Lab technologies, ongoing research and internal processes.
No interference with processes or systems was detected.
More details can be found in our technical paper.
From a threat actor point of view, the decision to target a world-class security company must be quite difficult.
On one hand, it almost surely means the attack will be exposed – it’s very unlikely that the attack will go unnoticed.
So the targeting of security companies indicates that either they are very confident they won’t get caught, or perhaps they don’t care much if they are discovered and exposed.
By targeting Kaspersky Lab, the Duqu attackers probably took a huge bet hoping they’d remain undiscovered; and lost.
At Kaspersky Lab, we strongly believe in transparency, which is why we are going public with this information.
Kaspersky Lab is confident that its clients and partners are safe and that there is no impact on the company’s products, technologies and services.
