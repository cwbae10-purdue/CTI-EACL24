Financial cyberthreats are malicious programs that attack users of online banking services, electronic money, cryptocurrency and other similar services, as well as threats aimed at gaining access to financial organizations and their infrastructure.
Kaspersky experts regularly analyze the statistics that the company’s products anonymously send to the cloud infrastructure of the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) in case users agree to transfer such data.
In order to study the threat landscape of the financial sector, the researchers analyzed cases of malicious activity on the devices of private users of Kaspersky’s security solutions.
Statistics on corporate users were collected from corporate security solutions, after the customers agreed to share their data with Kaspersky.
The information obtainedwas compared with data fromthe same period in 2018, to track the trends in the development of malware.
users We looked at quarterly results in order to compare statisitics for PC users, as we were able to divide the data into two catergories – corporate and private users.
Traditionally, the second and the third quarter might differ from the first and the fourth as these people often go on vaction and there less of corporate financial activity in these periods.
The most active malware families were then analyzed.
In the first half of 2019, more than 430,000 unique users were attacked by financial threats – seven percent more than during the same period in 2018
The number of financial attacks in the first half of 2019 was 10,493,792 – 93% more than in the first and second quarter of 2018
The number of malware samples from financial threats received by Kaspersky in the first half of 2019 was 5,242,462 – 74% more than the previous year
The countries with the largest share of users attacked by financial malware were China and Belarus (2.3% each).
In second and third place were Venezuela (2.2%) and South Korea (2.1%), respectively
During the first half of 2019, Kaspersky blocked more than 339,000 attempts to switch users to phishing pages pretending to be big banks
438,709 unique users encountered mobile financial threats in the first half of 2019 – 23% less than in the same period in 2018
The number of mobile financial attacks in the first half of 2019 was 3,730,378 – 107% more than in the first half of 2018
In the first half of 2019, Kaspersky experts detected 431,088 unique users[1] attacked by banking Trojans aimed at stealing funds and financial data, which was a seven percent increase compared to the same period in 2018 (400,830).
The number of unique attacked users, Q1 2018 – Q2 2019
The number of unique attacked users by user type, Q1 2018-Q2 2019
At the same time, the share of users attacked through corporate devices in the first half of 2019 reached 30.9%, while in the first half of 2018, this figure was half as much (15.3%).
Researchers also noticed an increased number of malicious files in 2019.
Thus, in the first quarter, the number of samples in the Kaspersky collection more than doubled, compared to the same period in 2018, reaching 335,000.
But in the second quarter, growth slowed down.
Number of samples of new financial malware, Q1 2018 – Q2 2019
Attacks have also become more frequent: the number of attempts to infect a device detected by Kaspersky’s protective solutions in both the first and second quarter of 2019 exceeded the corresponding figures of 2018 by 51% and 27%, respectively.

For a more complete analysis of the threat landscape, experts compiled a list of the most active banking Trojans in the first and second quarters of 2019, positioning them by the number of unique users that these threats attacked.
39.50% of corporate users were attacked by the RTM Trojan, one of the most common malware samples of the past year.
In second place was Emotet (14.90%), capable of loading malware onto an infected device.
For example, the Trickster Trojan, which can be installed on the victim’s computer, which is in third place in our ranking (12.30%).
Top 3 types of financial malware found in the first half of 2019
This is different for private users: the above-mentioned RTM and Emotet occupy second and third places with 24.5% and 6.4%, respectively, and in the first place is Zbot – one of the most common Trojans of 2018.
Such malware is usually spread with the help of email campaigns or through phishing sites.
In the first half of 2019, Kaspersky prevented more than 339,000 attempts to switch users to phishing pages that were designed as legitimate pages of large banks.
The top 10 countries with the largest share of users attacked by financial malware do not have geopolitical similarities and are not situated in a specific region.
In the first place were China and Belarus (2.3%), followed by Venezuela (2.2%) and South Korea (2.1%).
* Countries where the number of users of Kaspersky’s security solutions is relatively small (less than 10,000) are excluded from the ranking.
** The share of unique users attacked in relation to all users of Kaspersky ‘s security solutions in the country.
Top 10 countries by the proportion of unique users attacked by financial malware
In the first half of 2019, attackers actively used the names of the largest financial services and banking organizations to attack mobile platform users.
Researchers found 438,709 unique users attacked by mobile Trojan bankers.
For comparison, in the first half of 2018, the number of attacked users was 569,057, a decrease of 23%.
The number of users attacked by financial threats for mobile platforms, H1 2018 – H1 2019
Similar cases can be seen in the table representing the total number of attacks over this period.
The number of attacks of financial threats for mobile platforms, H1 2018 – H1 2019
The number of attacked users and detected attacks peaked rapidly in the second half of 2018.
1,333,410 users were attacked and and there were 10,256,935 attacks.
The reason behind this is the rapid growth in activity of the Asacub banker trojan and an increase in the distribution of the Svpeng banker trojan.
As it can be seen from Kaspersky’s records during this period, the number of Asacub attacks peaked in in the second half of 2018, multiplying almost a thousand times, comparing to figures of H1 2018.
However, the epidemics then calmed in H1 2019.
