In Q3 2019, we discovered an extremely unpleasant incident with the popular CamScanner app on Google Play.
The new version of the app contained an ad library inside with the Trojan dropper Necro built in.
Judging by the reviews on Google Play, the dropper’s task was to activate paid subscriptions, although it could deliver another payload if required.
Another interesting Trojan detected in Q3 2019 is Trojan.AndroidOS.Agent.vn.
Its main function is to “like” Facebook posts when instructed by its handlers.
Interestingly, to make the click, the Trojan attacks the Facebook mobile app on the infected device, literally forcing it to execute its command.
In the same quarter, we discovered new FinSpy spyware Trojans for iOS and Android.
In the fresh versions, the focus is on snooping on correspondence in messaging apps.
The iOS version requires a jailbreak to do its job, while the Android version is able to spy on the encrypted Threema app among others.
In Q3 2019, Kaspersky detected 870,617 malicious installation packages.
Number of detected malicious installation packages, Q4 2018 – Q3 2019 (download)
Whereas in previous quarters we observed a noticeable drop in the number of new installation packages, Q3’s figure was up by 117,067 packages compared to the previous quarter.
Distribution of detected mobile apps by type, Q2 and Q3 2019 (download)
Among all the mobile threats detected in Q3 2019, the lion’s share went to potentially unsolicited RiskTool-class programs (32.1%), which experienced a fall of 9 p.p.
against the previous quarter.
The most frequently detected objects were in the RiskTool.AndroidOS families: Agent (33.07% of all detected threats in this class), RiskTool.AndroidOS.Wapron (16.43%), and RiskTool.AndroidOS.Smssend (10.51%).
Second place went to miscellaneous Trojans united under the Trojan class (21.68%), their share increased by 10 p.p.
The distribution within the class was unchanged since the previous quarter, with the Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp (32.5%), Trojan.AndroidOS.Agent (12.8%), and Trojan.AndroidOS.Piom (9.1% ) families remaining in the lead.
Kaspersky’s machine-learning systems made a significant contribution to detecting threats: Trojans detected by this technology (the Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr verdict) made up 28.7% — second place after Hiddapp.
In third place were Adware-class programs (19.89%), whose share rose by 1 p.p.
in the reporting period.
Most often, adware programs belonged to one of the following families: AdWare.AndroidOS.Ewind (20.73% of all threats in this class), AdWare.AndroidOS.Agent (20.36%), and AdWare.AndroidOS.MobiDash (14.27%).
Threats in the Trojan-Dropper class (10.44%) remained at the same level with insignificant (0.5 p.p.)
growth.
The vast majority of detected droppers belonged to the Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Wapnor family (69.7%).
A long way behind in second and third place, respectively, were Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Wroba (14.58%) and Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Agent (8.75%).
Note that this malware rating does not include potentially dangerous or unwanted programs classified as RiskTool or adware.
* Unique users attacked by this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile solutions that were attacked.
First place in our TOP 20 as ever went to DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (48.71%), the verdict we use for malware detected using cloud technologies.
Cloud technologies are deployed when the antivirus databases lack data for detecting a piece of malware, but the company’s cloud already contains information about the object.
This is basically how the latest malicious programs are detected.
Second and six places were claimed by Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh (9.03%) and DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML (4.34%).
These verdicts are assigned to files recognized as malicious by our machine-learning systems.
Third, fourth, and fourteenth places were taken by members of the Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp family, whose task is to covertly foist ads onto victims.
Fifth, twelfth, eighteenth, and nineteenth positions went to Trojan droppers of the Necro family.
Although this family showed up on the radar last quarter, really serious activity was observed only in this reporting period.
Seventh place goes to Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a (1.99%), which is what members of the Necro family usually extract from themselves.
Helper.a is tasked with downloading arbitrary code from malicious servers and running it.
The eighth place was taken by the malware Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng.ak (1.75%), the main task of which is to steal online banking credentials and intercept two-factor authorization codes.
Ninth position went to Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Agent.ok (1.65%), which is distributed under the guise of FlashPlayer or a Rapidshare client.
Most commonly, it drops adware modules into the infected system.
Tenth and eleventh places went to members of the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Hqwar family.
The popularity of this dropper among cybercriminals continues to fall.

* Excluded from the rating are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky mobile solutions (under 10,000).
** Unique users attacked by mobile bankers as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile solutions in the country.
In Q3’s TOP 10, Iran (52.68%) retained top spot by share of attacked users.
Note that over the reporting period the country’s share almost doubled.
Kaspersky users in Iran most often encountered the adware app AdWare.AndroidOS.Agent.fa (22.03% of the total number of mobile threats), adware installing Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.bn (14.68% ) and the potentially unwanted program RiskTool.AndroidOS.Dnotua.yfe (8.84%).
Bangladesh (30.94%) retained second place in the ranking.
Users in this country most frequently encountered adware programs, including AdWare.AndroidOS.Agent.fс (27.58% of the total number of mobile threats) and AdWare.AndroidOS.HiddenAd.et (12.65%), as well as Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.cr (20.05%), which downloads adware programs.
India (28.75%) climbed to third place due to the same threats that were more active than others in Bangladesh: AdWare.AndroidOS.Agent.fс (36.19%), AdWare.AndroidOS.HiddenAd.et (17.17%) and Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.cr (22.05%).
In the reporting period, we detected 13,129 installation packages for mobile banking Trojans, only 770 fewer than in Q2 2019.
The largest contributions to the statistics came from the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng (40.59% of all detected banking Trojans), Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.
Agent (11.84%), and Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Faketoken (11.79%) families.

* Excluded from the rating are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky mobile solutions (under 10,000).
** Unique users attacked by mobile banking Trojans as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile solutions in the country.
In Q3 Russia moved up to first place (0.30%), which impacted the entire pattern of mobile bankers spread around the world.
Users in Russia were most often targeted with Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng.ak (17.32% of all attempts to infect unique users with mobile financial malware).
The same Trojan made it into the TOP 10 worldwide.
It is a similar story with second and third places: Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub.snt (11.86%) and Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng.q (9.20%).
South Africa fell to second place (0.20%), where for the second quarter in a row Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.dx (89.80% of all mobile financial malware) was the most widespread threat.
Bronze went to Kuwait (0.21%), where, like in South Africa, Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.dx (75%) was most often encountered.
In Q3 2019, we detected 13,179 installation packages for mobile ransomware — 10,115 fewer than last quarter.
We observed a similar drop in Q2, so since the start of the year the number of mobile ransomware Trojans has decreased almost threefold.
The reason, as we see it, is the decline in activity of the group behind the Asacub Trojan.

An exception was the distribution of a modified version of the Stockfolio investment app, which contained an encrypted reverse shell backdoor.
* Unique users attacked by this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS that were attacked.
Like last quarter, the adware Trojan Shlayer was the top threat for macOS.
This malware in turn downloaded adware programs of the Pirrit family, as a result of which its members took the second to fifth positions in our ranking.
* Excluded from the rating are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS (under 10,000) ** Unique users attacked as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS in the country.
The geographical distribution of attacked users underwent some minor changes: India took silver with 6.24% of attacked users, while Spain came in third with 5.61%.
France (6.95%) hung on to first position.
In Q3, the trend continued toward a decrease in the number of IP addresses of devices used to carry out attacks on Kaspersky Telnet honeypots.
If in Q2 Telnet’s share was still significantly higher than that of SSH, in Q3 the figures were almost equal.

The TOP 3 in Q3 2019 had the same faces as last quarter, only in a different order: the RTM family (19.3%) dropped from first to third, shedding almost 13 p.p., allowing the other two — Zbot (26.7%) and Emotet (23.9%) — to climb up.
Last quarter we noted a decline in the activity of Emotet servers, but in Q3 it came back on track, with Emotet’s share growing by more than 15 p.p.
Fourth and fifth places did not change at all — still occupied by Nimnul (6.6%) and Trickster (5.8%).
Their scores rose insignificantly, less than 1 p.p.
Of the new entries in our TOP 10, worth noting is the banker CliptoShuffler (5.4%), which stormed straight into sixth place.
The number of ransomware attacks against government agencies, as well as organizations in the healthcare, education, and energy sectors, continues to rise.
This trend we noted back in the previous quarter.
A new type of attack, one on network attached storages (NAS), is gaining ground.
The infection scheme involves attackers scanning IP address ranges in search of NAS devices accessible via the Internet.
Generally, only the web interface is accessible from the outside, protected by an authentication page; however, a number of devices have vulnerabilities in the firmware.
This enables cybercriminals, by means of an exploit, to install on the device a Trojan that encrypts all data on NAS-connected media.
This is a particularly dangerous attack, since in many cases the NAS is used to store backups, and such devices are generally perceived by their owners as a reliable means of storage, and the mere possibility of an infection can come as a shock.
Wipers have also become a more frequent attack tool.
Like ransomware, such programs rename files and make ransom demands.
But these Trojans irreversibly ruin the file contents (replacing them with zeros or random bytes), so even if the victim pays up, the original files are lost.
The FBI published decryption keys for GandCrab (verdict Trojan-Ransom.Win32.GandCrypt) versions 4 and 5.
The decryption was added to the latest RakhniDecryptor build.
In Q3 2019, we identified three new families of ransomware Trojans and discovered 13,138 new modifications of this malware.

As before, in the statistics on the distribution of exploits used by cybercriminals, a huge share belongs to vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Office suite (73%).
Most common of all, as in the previous quarter, were stack overflow errors (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802) in the Equation Editor application, which was previously part of Microsoft Office.
Other Microsoft Office vulnerabilities widely exploited this quarter were again CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-8759, and CVE-2017-0199.
Modern browsers are complex software products, which means that new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered and used in attacks (13%).
The most common target for cybercriminals is Microsoft Internet Explorer, vulnerabilities in which are often exploited in the wild.
This quarter saw the discovery of the actively exploited zero-day vulnerability CVE-2019-1367, which causes memory corruption and allows remote code execution on the target system.
The fact that Microsoft released an unscheduled patch for it points to how serious the situation was.
Nor was Google Chrome problem-free this quarter, having received updates to fix a number of critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-13685, CVE-2019-13686, CVE-2019-13687, CVE-2019-13688), some of which allow intruders to circumvent all levels of browser protection and execute code in the system, bypassing the sandbox.
The majority of vulnerabilities aimed at privilege escalation inside the system stem from individual operating system services and popular apps.
Privilege escalation vulnerabilities play a special role, as they are often utilized in malicious software to obtain persistence in the target system.
Of note this quarter are the vulnerabilities CVE-2019-14743 and CVE-2019-15315, which allow compromising systems with the popular Steam client installed.
A flaw in the Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework also warrants a mention.
A Google researcher published a tool to demonstrate the problem (CtfTool), which allows processes to be run with system privileges, as well as changes to be made to the memory of other processes and arbitrary code to be executed in them.
Distribution of exploits used in attacks by type of application attacked, Q3 2019 (download)
Network attacks are still widespread.
This quarter, as in previous ones, we registered numerous attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the SMB protocol.
This indicates that unprotected and not-updated systems are still at high risk of infection in attacks that deploy EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and other exploits.
That said, a large share of malicious network traffic is made up of requests aimed at bruteforcing passwords in popular network services and servers, such as Remote Desktop Protocol and Microsoft SQL Server.
RDP faced other problems too related to the detection of several vulnerabilities in this network protocol united under the common name DejaBlue (CVE-2019-1181, CVE-2019-1182, CVE-2019-1222, CVE-2019-1223, CVE-2019-1224, CVE-2019-1225, CVE-2019-1226).
Unlike the previously discovered CVE-2019-0708, these vulnerabilities affect not only old versions of operating systems, but new ones as well, such as Windows 10.
As in the case of CVE-2019-0708, some DejaBlue vulnerabilities do not require authorization in the attacked system and allow to carry out malicious activity invisible to the user.
Therefore, it is vital to promptly install the latest updates for both the operating system and antivirus solutions to reduce the risk of infection.
The statistics in this section are based on Web Anti-Virus, which protects users when malicious objects are downloaded from malicious/infected web pages.
Malicious websites are specially created by cybercriminals; web resources with user-created content (for example, forums), as well as hacked legitimate resources, can be infected.
The following statistics show the distribution by country of the sources of Internet attacks blocked by Kaspersky products on user computers (web pages with redirects to exploits, sites containing exploits and other malicious programs, botnet C&C centers, etc.).
Any unique host could be the source of one or more web-based attacks.
To determine the geographical source of web-based attacks, domain names are matched against their actual domain IP addresses, and then the geographical location of a specific IP address (GEOIP) is established.
In Q3 2019, Kaspersky solutions blocked 989,432,403 attacks launched from online resources located in 203 countries across the globe.
560,025,316 unique URLs triggered Web Anti-Virus components.
