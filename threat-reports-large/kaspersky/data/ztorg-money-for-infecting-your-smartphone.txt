This research started when we discovered an infected Pokémon GO guide in Google Play.
It was there for several weeks and was downloaded more than 500,000 times.
We detected the malware as Trojan.AndroidOS.Ztorg.ad.
After some searching, I found some other similar infected apps that were being distributed from the Google Play Store.
The first of them, called Privacy Lock, was uploaded to Google Play on 15 December 2016.
It was one of the most popular Ztorg modifications, with more than 1 million installations.
After I started tracking these infected apps, two things struck me – how rapidly they became popular and the comments in the user review sections.
These infected apps quickly became very popular, gaining thousands of new users each day!
For example, com.fluent.led.compass had 10,000–50,000 installations the day I found and reported it to Google.
However, it still wasn’t deleted from Google Play the next day and the number of installations increased tenfold to 100,000–500,000.
It means there were at least 50,000 new infected users in the space of just one day.
There were lots of comments saying that people downloaded these apps for credits/coins/etc.
In some of these comments the users mentioned other apps – Appcoins, Advertapp, etc.
That’s where this latest research work started.
The app mentioned most in the comments was Appcoins, so I installed it.
After that, the app prompted me to install some other apps, including one that was malicious, for $0.05.
To be honest, I was surprised that only one was malicious – all the other apps were clean.
The funny thing is that they check for root rights on the device and don’t pay those that have them.
And the first thing that Ztorg did on the device after infection started was to get superuser rights.
I contacted the Appcoins developers to try and find out where this malicious advertising offer came from, but they deleted the offer and answered me by saying there was no malware and that they had done nothing wrong.
Then I analyzed the apps installed by infected users and made a list of the most popular ones that paid users to install software:
mobi.appcoins
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.appcoins
com.smarter.superpocket
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smarter.superpocket
com.moneyreward.fun
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moneyreward.fun
And of course they offered malware too:
All these offered users 0.04-0.05 USD for installing an app infected with Ztorg from Google Play.
So I decided to take a closer look at these offers and the dumped traffic for these apps.
A typical session in which an advertising app turned into a malicious one was as follows:
App receives offers, including malicious ones, from its server (for example, moneyrewardfun.com).
Malicious offers are sent from well-known ad services (usually supersonicads.com and aptrk.com).
App receives offers, including malicious ones, from its server (for example, moneyrewardfun.com).
Malicious offers are sent from well-known ad services (usually supersonicads.com and aptrk.com).
After a few redirections from ad service domains (in one case there were 27 redirections) the app goes to global.ymtracking.com or avazutracking.net.
These URLs are related to the ads too.

These URLs are related to the ads too.
Then it redirects to track.iappzone.net.
Then it redirects to track.iappzone.net.
And the final URL that leads to the Google Play Store was app.adjust.com.
And the final URL that leads to the Google Play Store was app.adjust.com.
All the offers that I was able to dump had track.iappzone.net and app.adjust.com.
adjust.com is a well-known “business intelligence platform”; the URLs that are used in malicious campaigns look like this:
https://app.adjust.com/4f1lza?redirect=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.game.puzzle.green&install_callback=http://track.iappzone.net…
By analyzing these URLs we can identify infected apps on Google Play.
URLs from iappzone.net look like this:
http://track.iappzone.net/click/click?offer_id=3479&aff_id=3475&campaign=115523_201|1002009&install_callback=http://track.supersonicads.com/api/v1/processCommissionsCallback.php?advertiserId=85671&password=540bafdb&dynamicParameter=dp5601581629793224906
This URL structure (offer_id=..&aff_id=..&campaign=..) is related to the OffersLook tracking system.
It contains many interesting things, like offer id, affiliate id.
But it turns out that cybercriminals use different values for them, making these parameters unusable for us.
Except one – install_callback.
This parameter contains the name of the ad service.
While searching for iappzone.net I was able to find some APK files that contained this URL.
All of those files are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as Ztorg malware.
The interesting thing was that iappzone.net used the IP 52.74.22.232.
The same IP was used by aedxdrcb.com, which was mentioned in CheckPoint’s gooligan report.
A few weeks after that report was made public, iappzone.net (which wasn’t mentioned in the report) was moved to a new IP – 139.162.57.41.
Luckily I was able to find iappzone.net not only in the APK files but also in network traffic from clean apps.
All these apps had an advertising module – Batmobi or Mobvista in most cases.
Network traffic from these ad modules looked similar to the network traffic from the apps that paid users to install promoted apps.
Here is an example of an app with a Batmobi ad module.
The module received a JSON file with offers from their server api2.batmobil.net.
The user sees a list of advertised apps:
After the user clicks on the ads, they are redirected to the Google Play Store.
In this case, the redirects look like this:
api2.batmobil.net -> global.ymtracking.com->tracking.acekoala.com -> click.apprevolve.com ->track.iappzone.net ->app.adjust.com -> play.google.com
After analyzing ad campaigns containing iappzone.net, I was able to find almost 100 infected apps being promoted on Google Play.
The other interesting aspect of these campaigns was that their URLs contained the install_callback parameter that I mentioned earlier.
Turns out the cybercriminals only used four ad networks.
track.iappzone.net callbacks
However, this doesn’t mean that malware was only being distributed through these four networks.
These ad networks are selling their ads to a wide range of advertising companies.
In my research, I saw some malicious ads coming from other advertising networks like DuAd or Batmobi, but after a few redirects these ads were always pointing to one of the four advertising networks listed above.
Furthermore, I tracked several malicious ad campaigns that looked like this:
Batmobi -> Yeahmobi-> SupersonicAds
which means that these networks also redistribute ads to each other.
I wasn’t able to find any other ad networks in the install_callback parameter until the end of March 2017.
During my research I found some infected apps that were not promoted by these advertising networks.
When I looked at their detection paths I found that there were several patterns to them.
Most of the paths where these apps were detected (except the installation path /data/app) were as follows:
