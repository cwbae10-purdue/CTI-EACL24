Bogota, Colombia August 14, 2013
The Event was “Day of technology and DNS Security”.
This was the 3rd edition of a very technical conference where network experts discussed future trends in DNS Security, IP managing and IT Sec related issues.
This year Kaspersky Lab also participated and I had the opportunity to give a presentation about attacks on network devices and network attacks inside of the Colombian Internet space.
We also showed how Russian cybercriminal operations work inside the .CO space.
Speaking about .CO domains, these recently became very popular, which is why even cybercriminals have begun to use them.
The good thing is that the .CO provider takes security very seriously and takes down malicious domains very quickly.
The list of the participants included: Nic Chile, Renata, Internet Society, Lacnic, Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications of Colombia.
Raquel Gatto from Internet Society gave a presentation on the legal side of the regulation of the Internet and called for collaboration to make the Internet better.

Juan Alejo Peirano from Lacnic presented the current state of IPv4 in LatAm and the usage of IPv6 in the region.
He also showed practical scenarios of advanced network security by using IPv6 and DNSSec as best practices.
Mauricio Vergara from Nic Chile gave a very nice presentation on the practical management of DNS servers, how to secure them and what not to do in order to avoid any problems.
Also, he explained the way to obtain protection against DDoS attacks by using anycast.
