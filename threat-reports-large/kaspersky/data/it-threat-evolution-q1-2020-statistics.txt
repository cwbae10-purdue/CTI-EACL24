Q1 2020 will be remembered primarily for the coronavirus pandemic and cybercriminals’ exploitation of the topic.
In particular, the creators of a new modification of the Ginp banking trojan renamed their malware Coronavirus Finder and then began offering it for €0.75 disguised as an app supposedly capable of detecting nearby people infected with COVID-19.
Thus, the cybercriminals tried not only to scam users by exploiting hot topics, but to gain access to their bank card details.
And, because the trojan remains on the device after stealing this data, the cybercriminals could intercept text messages containing two-factor authorization codes and use the stolen data without the victim’s knowledge.
Another interesting find this quarter was Cookiethief, a trojan designed to steal cookies from mobile browsers and the Facebook app.
In the event of a successful attack, the malware provided its handler with access to the victim’s account, including the ability to perform various actions in their name, such as liking, reposting, etc.
To prevent the service from spotting any abnormal activity in the hijacked profile, the trojan contains a proxy module through which the attackers issue commands.
The third piece of malware that caught our attention this reporting quarter was trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Shopper.a.
It is designed to help cybercriminals to leave fake reviews and drive up ratings on Google Play.
The attackers’ goals here are obvious: to increase the changes of their apps getting published and recommended, and to lull the vigilance of potential victims.
Note that to rate apps and write reviews, the trojan uses Accessibility Services to gain full control over the other app: in this case, the official Google Play client.
In Q1 2020, Kaspersky’s mobile products and technologies detected 1,152,662 malicious installation packages, or 171,669 more than in the previous quarter.

Number of malicious installation packages detected, Q1 2019 – Q1 2020 (download)
Starting in Q2 2019, we have seen a steady rise in the number of mobile threats detected.
Although it is too early to sound the alarm (2019 saw the lowest number of new threats in recent years), the trend is concerning.
!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");
Distribution of newly detected mobile programs by type, Q1 2020 and Q4 2019 (download)
Of all the threats detected in Q1, half were unwanted adware apps (49.9%), their share having increased by 19 p.p.
compared to the previous quarter.
Most often, we detected members of the HiddenAd and Ewind families, with a combined slice of 40% of all detected adware threats, as well as the FakeAdBlocker family (12%).
Potentially unwanted RiskTool apps (28.24%) took second place; the share of this type of threat remained almost unchanged.
The Smsreg (49% of all detected threats of this class), Agent (17%) and Dnotua (11%) families were the biggest contributors.
Note that in Q1, the number of detected members of the Smsreg family increased by more than 50 percent.
In third place were Trojan-Dropper-type threats (9.72%).
Although their share decreased by 7.63 p.p.
against the previous quarter, droppers remain one of the most common classes of mobile threats.
Ingopack emerged as Q1’s leading family with a massive 71% of all Trojan-Dropper threats, followed by Waponor (12%) and Hqwar (8%) far behind.
It is worth noting that mobile droppers are most often used for installing financial malware, although some financial threats can spread without their help.
The share of these self-sufficient threats is quite substantial: in particular, the share of Trojan-Banker in Q1 increased by 2.1 p.p.
to 3.65%.
Note that this malware rankings do not include potentially dangerous or unwanted programs such as RiskTool or adware.
* Unique users attacked by this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile products that were attacked.
First place in our Top 20 as ever went to DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (44.89%), the verdict we use for malware detected using cloud technology.
They are triggered when the antivirus databases still lack the data for detecting a malicious program, but the Kaspersky Security Network cloud already contains information about the object.
This is basically how the latest malware is detected.
Second and third places were claimed by Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh (9.09%) and DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML (7,08%) respectively.
These verdicts are assigned to files that are recognized as malicious by our machine-learning systems.
In fourth (Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro.d, 4.52%) and tenth (Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro.b, 1.94%) places are members of the Necro family, whose main task is to download and install modules from cybercriminal servers.
Eighth-placed Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Necro.z (2.30%) acts in a similar way, extracting from itself only those modules that it needs.
As for Trojan.AndroidOS.Necro.a, which took ninth place (2.19%), cybercriminals assigned it a different task: the trojan follows advertising links and clicks banner ads in the victim’s name.
Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.ch (2.73%) claimed fifth spot.
As soon as it runs, the malware hides its icon on the list of apps and continues to operate in the background.
The trojan’s payload can be other trojan programs or adware apps.
Sixth place went to Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a (2.45%), which is what Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro usually delivers.
Helper.a is tasked with downloading arbitrary code from the cybercriminals’ server and running it.
The verdict Trojan.AndroidOS.Handda.san (2.31%) in seventh place is a group of diverse trojans that hide their icons, gain Device Admin rights on the device, and use packers to evade detection.
Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy.e (1.43%) and Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Penguin.e (1.42%) warrant a special mention.
The former is the only banking trojan in the top 20 this past quarter.
The Rotexy family is all of six years old, and its members have the functionality to steal bank card details and intercept two-factor payment authorization messages.
In turn, the first member of the Penguin dropper family was only detected last July and had gained significant popularity by Q1 2020.

Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by mobile threats
* Excluded from the rankings are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky mobile products (under 10,000).
** Unique users attacked as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile products in the country.
In Q1 2020, the leader by share of attacked users was Iran (39.56%).
Inhabitants of this country most frequently encountered adware apps from the Notifyer family, as well as Telegram clone apps.
In second place was Algeria (21.44%), where adware apps were also distributed, but this time it was the HiddenAd and FakeAdBlocker families.
Third place was taken by Bangladesh (18.58%), where half of the top 10 mobile threats consisted of adware in the HiddenAd family.
During the reporting period, we detected 42,115 installation packages of mobile banking trojans.
This is the highest value in the past 18 months, and more than 2.5 times higher than in Q4 2019.
The largest contributions to the statistics came from the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent (42.79% of all installation packages detected), Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Wroba (16.61%), and Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng (13.66%) families.

Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by mobile banking trojans
* Excluded from the rankings are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky mobile products (under 10,000).
** Unique users attacked by mobile banking trojans as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile products in the country.
In Q1 2020, Japan (0.57%) had the largest share of users attacked by mobile bankers; the vast majority of cases involved Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.eq.
In second place came Spain (0.48%), where in more than half of all cases, we detected malware from the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Cebruser family, and another quarter of detections were members of the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Ginp family.
Third place belonged to Italy (0.26%), where, as in Spain, the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Cebruser family was the most widespread with almost two-thirds of detections.
It is worth saying a bit more about the Cebruser family.
Its creators were among the first to exploit the coronavirus topic to spread the malware.
When it runs, the trojan immediately gets down to business: it requests access to Accessibility Services to obtain Device Admin permissions, and then tries to get hold of card details.
The malware is distributed under the Malware-as-a-Service model; its set of functions is standard for such threats, but with one interesting detail — the use of a step-counter for activation so as to bypass dynamic analysis tools (sandbox).
Cebruser targets the mobile apps of banks in various countries and popular non-financial apps; its main weapons are phishing windows and interception of two-factor authorization.
In addition, the malware can block the screen using a ransomware tool and intercept keystrokes on the virtual keyboard.
In Q2 2020, we detected 4,339 installation packages of mobile trojan ransomware, 1,067 fewer than in the previous quarter.

Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by mobile ransomware trojans:
* Excluded from the rankings are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky mobile products (under 10,000).
** Unique users attacked by mobile ransomware trojans as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile products in the country.
The leaders by number of users attacked by mobile ransomware trojans are Syria (0.28%), the United States (0.26%) and Kazakhstan (0.25%)
In Q1 2020, we detected not only new versions of common threats, but one new backdoor family, whose first member was Backdoor.OSX.Capip.a.
The malware’s operating principle is simple: it calls the C&C for a shell script, which it then downloads and executes.
* Unique users attacked by this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS who were attacked
The top 20 threats for macOS did not undergo any major changes in Q1 2020.
The adware trojan Shlayer.a (19.27%) still tops the leaderboard, followed by objects that Shlayer itself loads into the infected system, in particular, numerous adware apps from the Pirrit family.
Interestingly, the unwanted program Hoax.OSX.SuperClean.gen landed in 12th place on the list.
Like other Hoax-type programs, it is distributed under the guise of a system cleanup app, and immediately after installation, scares the user with problems purportedly found in the system, such as gigabytes of trash on the hard drive.
* Excluded from the rankings are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS (under 5,000) ** Unique users who encountered macOS threats as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS in the country.
The leading countries, as in previous quarters, were Spain (7.14%), France (6.94%) and Italy (5.94%).
The main contributors to the number of detections in these countries were the familiar Shlayer trojan and adware apps from the Pirrit family.
In Q1 2020, the share of IP addresses from which attempts were made to attack Kaspersky telnet traps increased significantly.
Their share amounted to 81.1% of all IP addresses from which attacks were carried out, while SSH traps accounted for slightly less than 19%.

* Share of malware type in the total amount of malware downloaded to IoT devices following a successful attack.
In Q1 2020, attackers most often downloaded the minimalistic trojan loader NyaDrop (64.35%), whose executable file does not exceed 500 KB.
Threats from the Mirai family traditionally dominated: its members claimed four places in our top 10.
These malicious programs will continue to rule the world of IoT threats for a long time to come, at least until the appearance of a more advanced (and publicly available) DDoS bot.
In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions blocked attempts to launch one or several types of malware designed to steal money from bank accounts on the computers of 249,748 users.

Ransomware attacks on organizations, as well as on city and municipal networks, did not ease off.
Given how lucrative they are for cybercriminals, there is no reason why this trend of several years should cease.
More and more ransomware is starting to supplement encryption with data theft.
To date, this tactic has been adopted by distributors of ransomware families, including Maze, REvil/Sodinokibi, DoppelPaymer and JSWorm/Nemty/Nefilim.
If the victim refuses to pay the ransom for decryption (because, say, the data was recovered from a backup copy), the attackers threaten to put the stolen confidential information in the public domain.
Such threats are sometimes empty, but not always: the authors of several ransomware programs have set up websites that do indeed publish the data of victim organizations.
In Q1 2020, we detected five new ransomware families and 5,225 new modifications of these malware programs.
