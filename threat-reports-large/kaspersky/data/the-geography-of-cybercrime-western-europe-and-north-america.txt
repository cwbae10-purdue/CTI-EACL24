Conclusion
The Internet knows no borders, but according to our data, cybercrime has specific ‘geographical features’.
In different parts of the world cybercriminals launch different malicious programs, their attacks have different priorities and they use different tricks to make money.
This is not just due to their physical location, but also due to the nature of the countries where their potential victims are located.
The key factors in this case are the level of economic development, the number of Internet users and the level of Internet penetration in the country.
In this article we will analyze the specifics of cybercriminal activity in western countries: the USA, Canada and Western Europe (the UK, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Portugal).
