This year’s DBIR release from Verizon exposes valuable and well organized data on global incidents this past year.
Our contributions on targeted attack activity and other areas to a report like this one over the past several years is important to help to improve cyber-security awareness and education both in the security industry and the general public.
The report is well organized, offering trending information from Point of Sale incidents to cyber-espionage, web application hacking, cybercrime, and skimming.
And it simplifies most of the data into nine categories for ease of discussion.
The data demonstrates that intruders will use tried and true techniques before moving on to the newest and most expensive.
Like most years in cybersecurity, “It’s like déjà vu, all over again.” —Yogi Berra
You can download the 2016 DBIR here, its 85 pages of data and diagrams can help provide informed discussion around these topics on a greater scale.
We look forward to another great writeup in 2017 from the DBIR guys at Verizon.
