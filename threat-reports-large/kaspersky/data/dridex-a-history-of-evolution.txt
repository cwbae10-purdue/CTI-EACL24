The Dridex banking Trojan, which has become a major financial cyberthreat in the past years (in 2015, the damage done by the Trojan was estimated at over $40 million), stands apart from other malware because it has continually evolved and become more sophisticated since it made its first appearance in 2011.
Dridex has been able to escape justice for so long by hiding its main command-and-control (C&C) servers behind proxying layers.
Given that old versions stop working when new ones appear and that each new improvement is one more step forward in the systematic development of the malware, it can be concluded that the same people have been involved in the Trojan’s development this entire time.
Below we provide a brief overview of the Trojan’s evolution over six years, as well as some technical details on its latest versions.
Dridex made its first appearance as an independent malicious program (under the name “Cridex”) around September 2011.
An analysis of a Cridex sample (MD5: 78cc821b5acfc017c855bc7060479f84) demonstrated that, even in its early days, the malware could receive dynamic configuration files, use web injections to steal money, and was able to infect USB media.
This ability influenced the name under which the “zero” version of Cridex was detected — Worm.Win32.Cridex.
That version had a binary configuration file:
Sections named databefore, datainject, and dataafter made the web injections themselves look similar to the widespread Zeus malware (there may have been a connection between this and the 2011 Zeus source code leak).
In 2012, a significantly modified Cridex variant (MD5: 45ceacdc333a6a49ef23ad87196f375f) was released.
The cybercriminals had dropped functionality related to infecting USB media and replaced the binary format of the configuration file and packets with XML.
Requests sent by the malware to the C&C server looked as follows:
