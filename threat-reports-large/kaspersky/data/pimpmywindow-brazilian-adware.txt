Brazilian cybercrime is based primarily on the spread of Trojan bankers.
For some time now the country’s bad guys have been investing their efforts in new monetization schemes, the latest includes the use of adware.
And the perfect place for distributing this sort of malware?
Yes, that’s right – social networks.
This is how “PimpMyWindow”, an adware and click-fraud scheme that has infected several Brazilian Facebook users in recent days, works.
To spread quickly among innocent users the adware uses a “change the color of your profile” option that recently surfaced.
The infected profiles are used to spread automatic messages to your Facebook contacts:
“Tired of the color of your profile?
Install PimpMyWindow now”
The website offers a plug-in for the three most popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox and IE.
Sorry Opera users, no adware version available for you…
Once it’s installed, it’s programmed to display ads from Google’s Adsense on popular social network websites such as Ask.fm, Orkut, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, webmail services such as Gmail and Hotmail, and the Google.com search engine.
Hotmail displaying Google AdSense ads?
No, it’s adware!
