At SAS 2017, on April 1st and 2nd on St. Maarten, Global Director of GReAT Costin Raiu and Principal Security Researchers Vitaly Kamluk and Sergey Mineev will provide YARA training for incident response specialists and malware researchers, who need an effective arsenal for finding malware.
During the training, the experts will give participants access to some of Kaspersky Lab internal systems, which are otherwise closed to the public, to demonstrate how the company’s malware analysts catch rare samples.
After two days, even being a newcomer, you’ll walk away with the ability to write rules and start using the tool for hunting malware.
