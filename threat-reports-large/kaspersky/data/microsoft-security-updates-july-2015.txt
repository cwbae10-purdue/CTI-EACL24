Microsoft releases a long list of updates to multiple technologies today with 14 Security Bulletins (MS15-058, MS15-065 – MS15-077) patching 58 vulnerabilities, and at least 47 of them reported through a a responsible disclosure channel.
Meanwhile, several are being used and detected ITW as a part of limited targeted attacks, like the Microsoft Office RCE cve-2015-2424, ATMFD.DLL EoP cve-2015-2387, and the Internet Explorer JScript9 RCE cve-2015-2419.
Some were the result of breach leaks as well.
A number of these have a very attractive offensive utility to defend against, so expect to see these exploits being used and re-used.
Most of the July updates fall under two main categories, and the updated technologies are listed below.
All of the Windows versions from Windows 7 and up maintain a critical RCE vulnerability of one sort or another.
Update ASAP.
Remote code execution vulnerabilities
Windows Server Hyper-V
Windows DLL Handling
SQL Server
Internet Explorer
VBScript Engine
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Microsoft Office
Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities
Windows Graphics Component
Windows Kernel (win32k.sys)
Windows Installer Service
OLE
Windows Remote Procedure Call Service
Windows ATM Font Driver
SQL Server
Vulnerabilities falling under other categories like XSS filter bypass, information disclosure, ASLR bypass, authentication spoofing
Internet Explorer
Microsoft Excel
Netlogon
Windows Kernel (win32k.sys)
The most interesting of these vulnerabilities includes the RDP RCE and the Hyper-V RCE.
The RDP vulnerability affects even the stripped down Windows Server 2012 Server Core installation, and seems to have been reported by an anonymous source unusually wanting no credit for a remotely exploitable critical vulnerability for a service that is often externally exposed.
While Microsoft is doubtful that remote code execution is reliable, they at least acknowledge the possibility.
In the past, their denial had been corrected by researchers on the potential for heap feng shei leading to exploitation of certain services, including the 2010 bug in their IIS FTPsvc.
Another couple are the Hyper-V RCE, which are buffer overflow cve-2015-2361 in the Storvsp.sys driver and an unusual “data structure vulnerability” cve-2015-2362 present in Vmicrdv.dll, Vmicvss.dll, Vmicshutdown.dll, Vmictimesync.dll, Vmicheartbeat.dll, and Vmickvpexchange.dll, available across Windows Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
These were both found by an internal Microsoft engineer.
Much like the Cloudburst exploit from years ago on VMWare, these enable code with execution escape from a virtual guest operating system into the host system.
