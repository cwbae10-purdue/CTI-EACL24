These statistics are based on detection verdicts of Kaspersky Lab products received from users who consented to provide statistical data.
According to Kaspersky Security Network:

13,075 installation packages for mobile ransomware Trojans.
Perhaps the biggest news of the reporting period was the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub epidemic.
It peaked in September when more than 250,000 unique users were attacked – and that only includes statistics for those with Kaspersky Lab’s mobile products installed on their devices.
Number of users attacked by the mobile banker Asacub in 2017 and 2018
The scale of the attack involving Asacub by far surpasses the largest attacks we have previously observed while monitoring mobile threats.
The Trojan’s versions have sequential version numbers, suggesting the attacks were launched by just one threat actor.
It’s impossible to count the total number of affected users, but it would need to be in the tens of thousands to make such a massive malicious campaign profitable.
In Q3 2018, Kaspersky Lab detected 1,305,015 malicious installation packages, which is 439,229 less packages than in the previous quarter.
Number of detected malicious installation packages, Q3 2017 – Q3 2018
Among all the threats detected in Q3 2018, the lion’s share belonged to potentially unwanted RiskTool apps (52.05%); compared to the previous quarter, their share decreased by 3.3 percentage points (p.p.).
Members of the RiskTool.AndroidOS.SMSreg family contributed most to this.
Distribution of newly detected mobile apps by type, Q2 – Q3 2018
Second place was occupied by Trojan-Dropper threats (22.57%), whose share increased by 9 p.p.
Most files of this type belonged to the Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Piom, Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Wapnor and Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Hqwar families.
The share of advertising apps continued to decrease and accounted for 6.44% of all detected threats (compared to 8.91% in Q2 2018).
The statistics show that the number of mobile financial threats has been rising throughout 2018, with the proportion of mobile banker Trojans increasing from 1.5% in Q1, to 4.38% of all detected threats in Q3.
TOP 20 mobile malware
* This malware rating does not include potentially dangerous or unwanted programs such as RiskTool or adware.
** Unique users attacked by the given malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky Lab’s mobile antivirus that were attacked.
First place in our TOP 20 once again went to DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (55.85%), the verdict we use for malware that’s detected using cloud technologies.
Cloud technologies work when antivirus databases do not yet contain the data to detect a malicious program but the company’s cloud antivirus database already includes information about the object.
This is basically how the very latest malicious programs are detected.
In second place was Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh (11.39%).
This verdict is given to files that our system recognizes as malicious based on machine learning.
