Ok Take a look at the following screenshots.
What do you notice?
Subject: “Perfect gift for royal baby … a tree?” – BreakingNews CNN
Subject: “Snowden able to leave Moscow airport” – BreakingNews CNN
Well both unsurprisingly are using very topical headline grabbing news to entice us to click on the links.
It seems that the spammers are using a template and then mix and match them.
The first one is especially interesting as the subject is about the royal baby.
We have blogged already about spam using this hot theme.
Either this is a mistake or a deliberate ploy by them.
In any case it’s in very bad taste linking a happy, joyous event with such a tragedy!
We have seen many emails of this kind and with the same structure.
Every letter has a “video” frame or a picture.
Every link’s address is an infected page.
You are then redirected several times before you reach the exploit.
Kaspersky detects this as: HEUR:Exploit.Script.Generic.
This exploit infects a computer with
Trojan-PSW.Win32.Fareit.pjt a password stealer.
In particular it looks for browser cookies, ftp client credentials and email passwords.
