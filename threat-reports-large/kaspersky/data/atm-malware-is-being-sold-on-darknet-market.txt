ATM systems appear to be very secure, but the money can be accessed fairly easily if you know what you are doing.
Criminals are exploiting hardware and software vulnerabilities to interact with ATMs, meaning they need to be made more secure.
This can be achieved with the help of additional security software, properly configured to stop the execution of non-allowlisted programs on ATMs.
Worryingly, it is very easy to find detailed manuals of ATM malware.
Anybody can simply buy them for around 5000 USD on darknet markets.
More information about CutletMaker ATM malware is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service.

In May 2017, Kaspersky Lab researchers discovered a forum post advertising ATM malware that was targeting specific vendor ATMs.
The forum contained a short description of a crimeware kit designed to empty ATMs with the help of a vendor specific API, without interacting with ATM users and their data.
The post links to an offer that was initially published on the AlphaBay Darknet marketplace, which was recently taken down by the FBI.

The price of the kit was 5000 USD at the time of research.
The AlphaBay description includes details such as the required equipment, targeted ATMs models, as well as tips and tricks for the malware’s operation.
And part of a detailed manual for the toolkit was also provided.

Previously described ATM malware Tyupkin was also mentioned in this text.
The manual “Wall ATM Read Me.txt” was distributed as a plain text file, written in poor English and with bad text formatting.
The use of slang and grammatical mistakes suggests that this text was most likely written by a native Russian-speaker.

The manual provides a detailed picture, though only a fragment of the complete manual is being shown.
