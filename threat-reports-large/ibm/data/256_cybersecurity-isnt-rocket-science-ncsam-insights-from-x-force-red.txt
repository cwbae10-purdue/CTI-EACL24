October has long been Halloween season, but in 2004 it became National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM) as well.
Given this confluence of events, it seemed like the perfect time for a conversation about some scary security blunders and, because we don’t want our listeners to have nightmares, some tips for resurrecting your security strategy.
Listen now to hear Space Rogue and Videoman, both of IBM X-Force Red, share horror stories from the trenches and then offer their advice for keeping your organization secure in October and throughout the year.
