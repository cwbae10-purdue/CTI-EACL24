Today IBM announced the newly formed IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) team.
This group of exceptionally talented and passionate consultants and analysts is focused on becoming our clients’ trusted security partner.
X-Force IRIS experts collaborate with clients to provide solutions for the most challenging information security problems.
IBM has made significant investments in cognitive technology — Watson — to solve the world’s most challenging problems, which is one of the reasons I joined the team earlier this year.
Today, we leverage Watson in health care to enhance cancer research and diagnoses throughout the world, in the weather industry to predict the next big storm and in financial services to help manage regulatory compliance.
In the future, we will integrate Watson into security technologies to address threat intelligence and incident response challenges facing companies, their employees and their data.
IBM will empower security professionals to make more informed, timely and accurate decisions to protect the most important intellectual property of today’s businesses.
All the members of this formidable team feel fortunate to share a singular passion for keeping attackers away from our clients’ environments.
Although simply stated, this mission is a complex, ever-changing solution to the most advanced security issues facing organizations throughout the world.
Helping companies save time, money and reputation is valuable — allowing them to focus on their business rather than worry about the next security incident is ideal.

IBM X-Force IRIS represents a major milestone for IBM Security Services.
This will be a transformational security journey with our clients.
By most measures, today’s security threats, incidents and breaches are not entirely containable within the timeframes in which we need to prevent the attacker from causing damage.
But for organizations with strategic implementation of incident response and intelligence capabilities, risks can be mitigated and negative impact contained to manageable and cost-effective levels.
IBM has faced many challenges to stay relevant in its 110-plus years of operations.
The introduction of IBM X-Force IRIS is just one more step forward.
To achieve the levels of computer threat intelligence necessary to proactively protect our clients’ most important assets and prevent attacks, we need to offer the next generation of technology.
To this end, we are making significant investments in our people, services and solutions to enable all our clients can leverage industry-leading capabilities that detect, respond to and prevent attacks.
We look forward to sharing our collective expertise, opinions and unique experiences across security intelligence, incident response and remediation.

I am honored to be a part of this exciting group and look forward to providing our clients with a new breed of IBM Security.
