Sometimes unlikely pairings work together even better than expected, whether itâ€™s a juxtaposition of flavors in cooking (fried chicken and waffles, anyone?)
or a friendship of opposites.
Over the past year we at IBM have joined forces with other companies to build a collaborative defense community to help us all extend the value of IBM Security solutions.
In the IBM Security App Exchange, you can find apps, dashboards, and rulesets that provide integration points with other security vendors to better prevent, detect, and respond to emerging threats.
By allowing customers, developers, and business partners to share these applications, extensions, and enhancements, IBM helps clients share best practices and improve data sharing across their security solutions.
