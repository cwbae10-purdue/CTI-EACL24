Wouldn’t it be nice if life were like a movie where we had the rugged handsomeness of a neo-noir hero, it was easy to tell the good guys from the bad and malware announced itself as soon as it entered your network?
Alas, cyberattacks don’t reveal themselves in blaring lines of identifiable code that ignite a room of perfectly coifed forensics analysts into action.

Crippling malcode now lies in wait: a dormant dweller that you’ll never be able to identify without smart (not well-coifed) IT professionals and analytic algorithms that expect the unexpected.
Remember the “Blade Runner” Replicants of the far-off future, with androids becoming more than machine?
It was an android so sophisticated that Harrison Ford’s Decker could only see behind the veil by breaking down the very root of the being’s logic and semblance of awareness with a sophisticated bio-response lie detector.
Malware is smart, and it’s getting Replicant-smarter every day.
But you can be a Decker in days with the right endpoint protection.
The security researchers at IBM X-Force have seen a multitude of malware samples.
