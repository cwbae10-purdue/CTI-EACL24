The key to a good defense is to know your enemy.
In the cybersecurity realm, that means defenders must understand how attackers operate to better protect against and counteract their attempts.
Adversarial goals and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) can be very different for each incident, but all attacks share some core concepts that defenders can work with to expose malevolent activity before it causes damage.
Those common core concepts are the foundation of IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services’ (IRIS) cyberattack preparation and execution frameworks, which highlight the team’s unique approach to characterizing and communicating threat intelligence to help organizations protect their networks and users.
X-Force IRIS is a team of skilled professionals who proactively help organizations fortify their defenses against today’s evolving global threat landscape.
The team’s approach helps security teams inside and outside of IBM understand the design and execution of a cyberattack in a detailed, organized manner.
Analysts can use that insight to help identify and respond to threats that are relevant to their organization.
This white paper presents frameworks that explain the range of activities that can occur both prior to and during an actual network compromise.
Read the complete paper to learn:
Why X-Force IRIS developed cyberattack preparation and execution frameworks;
The key elements the frameworks address in the overall cyberattack model;
The key phases of cyberattacks that can help security teams improve prevention and response;
How to communicate complex threat information with ease and control.
