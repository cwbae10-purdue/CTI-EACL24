From the early instances of Locky to the more recent infestation of the WannaCry attacks, ransomware is unquestionably on the rise.
Ransomware is commonly received by the victim through an unsolicited email from an unknown sender as an attachment or else injected into a userâ€™s browser session through a web browser vulnerability.
The widespread success of ransomware is due to several factors, including the fact that it does not require administrative privileges like other malware.
In addition, many companies do not maintain current and complete back-ups of their data and assets, which leaves them vulnerable to this type of attack.
