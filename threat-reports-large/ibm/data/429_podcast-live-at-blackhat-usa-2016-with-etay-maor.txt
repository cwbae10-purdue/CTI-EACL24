Couldn’t make it to Las Vegas this year for Black Hat USA?
Now’s your chance to hear about the hottest sessions and how the highly anticipated annual event has adapted to changes in the security industry.
In this short interview, IBM Executive Security Advisor Etay Maor describes Black Hat 2016’s holistic approach.
Long known for its “how-to-hack” sessions, Maor notes that Black Hat maintained its technical focus while adding more emphasis on incident response and how to cope in the aftermath of a cyberattack.
Security is no longer just an IT issue, and Maor found that this year’s Black Hat conference reflected that shift by presenting more content of interest to C-level professionals.
Listen to the full podcast for more insights from Black Hat 2016, including Maor’s favorite sessions and [spoiler alert!]
why chip-and-PIN credit cards are not the panacea the retail industry was hoping for.
