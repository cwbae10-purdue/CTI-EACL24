There has been a lot of excitement and buzz in the industry about Big Data, and how it can be used to amplify Security Intelligence to provide greater protection against advanced threats, fraud, and insider threats.
IBM’s integrated Security Intelligence and Big Data solution does all of this and more.
Using our solution, you can identify suspicious external domains and endpoints that your systems and users are connecting to, identify dangerous external command and control domains, and find users who are prone to attacks such as spear phishing due to their propensity to click on suspicious url’s.
This enables organizations not only to identify and mitigate risk from typical security events and information, but also help identify enterprise risks from the massive amount of non-security specific data.
But don’t take it from me, seeing is believing.
For your technical interest, check out this short demonstration given by Jose Bravo of the IBM Security Tiger Team that showcases the power of IBM QRadar Security Intelligence working with Big Data.
In this video, you can see how IBM Security QRadar and the Big Data Platform:
Investigates IP addresses, domains, and registration data to determine which are suspicious in nature and could be the source of malware and other types of attacks
Analyzes log data and extracts a list of domains accessed by users in your organization showing user information, geographic location of the domain, url’s, ports, and more
Shares data with the BigInsights component of our Big Data Platform, adds data from IBM X-Force Trend and Risk Report, and allows you to identify risky users, risky domains they are accessing, and risky IP addresses.
Puts this information into reference sets that are exported back into IBM Security QRadar so new rules can be created to identify potentially harmful behavior and take action ahead of the threat.
