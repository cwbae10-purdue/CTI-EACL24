It is always thrilling when thought leaders endorse, agree with or support a major initiative.
But, far more powerful is when analysts comment publically or write reports aimed at customers and partners with a message that a vendor understands their pain and is successfully executing a strategy that addresses that pain in a unique and comprehensive way.
It is now clear to CISOs and security leaders that placing the burden of deploying a bunch of siloed point products in a multi-perimeter world squarely on them or on their partners is no longer good business.
IBM Security recently closed on the acquisition of Trusteer, a very successful advanced malware and fraud protection provider, who in a very short period of time has dominated the financial industry with their solution.
We are thrilled to have this excellent company made up of excellent employees on our team.
Having been acquired by IBM less than two years ago, and having grown this new Security Systems division rapidly in that time period, we know the challenges and how to best provide our customers and partners with both the best-in-class products they require and also the broad platform and integrated solutions more and more customers are demanding.
Proof of execution:
The QRadar Security Intelligence Platform has seen its sales go through the roof after being acquired by IBM
Each of the Security System division’s pillars (People, Infrastructure, Data, Applications, and Security Intelligence) has seen solid and steady growth
More and more customers and partners are subscribing to our “Security Intelligence, Think Integrated” strategy
Prior to the Q1 Labs acquisition, Forrester’s assessment of this acquisition would likely have included a much stronger note of caution to S&R (security and Risk Management) pros.
However, the success of the Q1 Labs acquisition, together with IBM’s strong commitment to security as a strategic priority, should give confidence to S&R pros considering Trusteer solutions in both the short term and the long term.
Overall, the acquisition is good news for both IBM and Trusteer customers.
Positive on IBM’s deal to acquire web fraud prevention provider Trusteer, because it not only positions IBM to dominate the web fraud prevention market, but brings new enterprise anti-malware technology, critical threat research and intelligence capabilities, and a stronger presence in the security as a service market.
It’s early, but there is a clear opportunity for someone to totally disrupt the endpoint protection racket.
Similar to what Palo Alto did to the perimeter firewall.
IBM is betting on being able to spur that disruption.
So is this the beginning of the end for EPP?
If you take a step back, EPP has been on a path to irrelevance for years.
This acquisition brings IBM into direct competition with advanced endpoint malware-detection and -protection providers such as Bit9, Bromium, AccessData, Guidance Software, HBGary, Mandiant, Tanium and Viewfinity.
It could mark an enhanced stance whereby Big Blue extends its capabilities to incorporate advanced malware-detection capabilities at the network layer.
Certainly IBM is in a favorable position to build up a strong cybersecurity competence.
Innovation through acquisition is one way to do it, and IBM has the resources.
The realization of its security strategy will lie in the successful integration of all these acquisitions into its overall value proposition, as well as the ability to accommodate other vendor’s technology.
This is especially important since the current market for cybersecurity is highly fragmented, with many organizations opting for a multitude of different solutions for securing their networks, systems, endpoints, and data.
Look for IBM to also get the most out of the Trusteer Cybercrime Prevention Architecture, a technology stack that includes device-based protection, middleware services, and cloudbased intelligence.
This architecture gives IBM the opportunity to integrate Trusteer security technology with existing products, layer in other acquisitions, or work on common solutions with 3rd party partners.
With the Trusteer acquisition, IBM fills in a few product gaps and continues to demonstrate its intentions to compete in all aspects of enterprise security.
Look for IBM to continue to be aggressive and set the pace.
This is a big deal!
Good move!
Big Blue is marketing Trusteer’s wares beyond the financial sector.
With IBM planning to acquire Trusteer, a security software company specializing in anti-fraud products for financial services organizations, enterprises can expect to see security technology that originally targeted financial institutions spread into the broader security market.
IBM could expand into the advanced threats market, web application security and endpoint protection.
