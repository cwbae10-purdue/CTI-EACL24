Last October, we wrote about a new universal man-in-the-browser (uMitB) scam that doesn’t target specific websites but instead collects data submitted to any website without the need for post-processing (parsing through logs to extract valuable data).
At the time, we posted a marketing video from the webinject developer that demonstrates two uMitB attacks.
Recently, we came across another marketing video by the same developer that demonstrates a new uMitB attack that targets any website that accepts credit cards.
It uses “Verified by Visa” and “MasterCard SecureCode” screens to manipulate victims.
The webinject uses the Luhn algorithm to first verify that the card number submitted by the user is legitimate.
If it is, the webinject pops up with a fake Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode screen.
This exploit is designed to capture the victim’s full card details and their Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode passwords.
The webinject can be purchased for $555.
This video illustrates the increasing sophistication of webinject technology and its ability to capture the data necessary to bypass additional security measures such as Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode.
Once malware has gained a foothold on the endpoint device, it is virtually impossible for users to tell the difference between a legitimate Web page and a malicious webinject.
The only way to protect against these exploits is with technology that can prevent advanced, data-stealing malware from infecting endpoint devices and detecting/blocking it in real time when it does find its way onto the device.
