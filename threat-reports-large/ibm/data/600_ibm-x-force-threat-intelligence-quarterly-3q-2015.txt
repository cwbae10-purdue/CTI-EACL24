More than just a Hollywood trope, the Dark Web provides cover for nefarious individuals and organizations to launch anonymous attacks on corporate networks to exfiltrate valuable data.
Attackers are targeting high-value communities and enterprises through this network of virtual tunnels and evolving threats like ransomware.
Read this issue of the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Quarterly to learn more from the security research experts at IBM X-Force about how to protect your network.
Topics include:
Ransomware: How has it evolved into a threat that nets criminals millions of dollars each year through “ransomware as a service” toolkits and “ransomweb” attacks targeting specific high-value communities?
Should companies take measures to block connections to the Dark Web from their networks in order to limit attack surface and liability issues from content originating from Tor nodes?
Vulnerability disclosures in the first half of 2015 totaled just over 4,000, and are on track to be the lowest in four years.
The updated CVSS v3 scoring methodology now more accurately reflects the scope and impact of modern vulnerabilities.
