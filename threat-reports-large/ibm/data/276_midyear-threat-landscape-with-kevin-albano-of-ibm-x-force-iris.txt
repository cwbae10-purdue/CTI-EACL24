The first half of 2017 passed in a flash, though it may not have always felt that way to members of IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS).
One large-scale cyberattack followed another in early 2017, with Shamoon kicking off the year, only to be followed by the even higher-profile WannaCry and Petya attacks.
In this podcast, Kevin Albano, X-Force IRIS global lead for threat intelligence, discusses the trends he and his team have followed so far in 2017, including the growing use of destructive malware and the targeting of productivity software such as Microsoft Office and Google Docs.
Kevin also make predictions for the months ahead (spoiler alert: ransomware isnâ€™t going away) and shares insights into the inner workings of the IRIS team.
