Ever wonder how cyberattacks and malware are created, and how they get into your system to steal your data?
See the life of a cyberthreat first hand, from the moment of its inception within the Dark Web of hackers, to when it is sent around the world to infect as many systems as possible.
With collaboration across the networks of “good guys,” we can help stop these exploits from being shared and spread.
Similar to how vaccinations and health warnings can help to stop a disease pandemic, having the right protocols in place can help send malware back to the Dark Web for good.
