Data theft is a year-round, opportunistic crime, but seasonal events often trigger rises in spam and fraud.
The most significant such example is tax fraud riding the wave of tax filing season.
Every year, tax filing season, which extends from January to April in the U.S., is one of the most popular opportunities for cybercriminals to perpetrate scam ploys.
As soon as January rolls around, the volume of email flooding potential victims with tax return-themed spam begins rising gradually.
The most common crimes that ensue are fraudulent tax returns on the consumer side and W-2 fraud on the business side.
