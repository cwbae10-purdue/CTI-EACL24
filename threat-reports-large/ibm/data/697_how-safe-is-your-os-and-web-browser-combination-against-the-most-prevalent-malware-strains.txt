Despite growing security measures, malware and Trojans are not only growing in number, but are also increasing in sophistication.
Malware authors constantly seek new ways to use existing and/or unpatched zero-day vulnerabilities to create the next breed of cybercrime techniques.
A recent blog post by Kafeine, a notable security researcher, makes reference to an undocumented vulnerability in Adobe Flash that targets different combinations of Internet Explorer versions running on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Mac and Linux.
Attacks against unpatched vulnerabilities are popping up regularly and sometimes take months or even years for software publishers to patch.
Armed with this knowledge, fraudsters rely on these time gaps when they design new techniques that are capable of stealing customer credentials and performing fraudulent transactions such as transferring money to new destinations â€” often without the victim being aware that anything is amiss.
To top it off, cybercriminals are aware of the various fraud prevention technologies many organizations deploy and try to use this knowledge when designing new attack mechanisms to circumvent their existing fraud controls.
For example, fraudsters can bypass various forms of authentication by using social engineering campaigns to convince users to divulge their credentials.
The following are extracts from our latest infographic, as observed in the last quarter of 2014 by the IBM Security Trusteer research team.
