Running capture the flag exercises on a well-equipped cyber range can help organizations both to build security skills and to identify gaps.
The ongoing growth and evolution of attacks, coupled with the heated race between the skills of the attacker and the capabilities of security analysts, is leaving many companies struggling to find the resources and skills required to develop appropriate response plans and education for their employees.
