Hiloti generic downloader is a Trojan that was first seen in December 2008 and has shown a dramatic increase in infection rates of PCs during June 2011.
The malware is a generic malware downloader, meaning it typically downloads other malware such as Zeus and SpyEye.
Hiloti creates a malicious DLL in the Windows directory and hacks the Windows registry to maintain its presence on an infected machine across a normal boot cycle.
IBM analysts suspect that a Hiloti-infecting campaign — quite likely a drive-by download infection — is now taking place, having started on June 20.
Here is a typical infection graph from the U.K., which shows that Hiloti malware attacks are surging to two to three times previous levels of infection:
What’s interesting is that the infection does not appear to be affecting the U.S. and other international territories, suggesting that it is a carefully targeted attack on one or more U.K. banking portals.
IBM Security’s research teams will continue to monitor the levels of infection of Hiloti.
