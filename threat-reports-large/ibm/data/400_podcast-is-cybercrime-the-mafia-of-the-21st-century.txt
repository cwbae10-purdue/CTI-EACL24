In this exclusive podcast IBM Executive Security Advisor Limor Kessem discusses some of the top fraud threats facing enterprise organizations.
Currently standing out among the vast array of threats is ransomware, which spread rapidly to become a formidable force in 2016.
Kessem describes ransomware as a lazy fraudster’s dream – without much specialized knowledge or skill, a criminal can infect victims and then simply wait for the money to roll in.
And with ransomware kits available for sale on underground cybercrime forums, it’s easier than ever to bring a targeted organization to its knees.

But while the baddies seem to have the advantage at the moment, there is some good news on the horizon.
Collaborative tools like the IBM X-Force Exchange are providing real-time threat intelligence that helps the good guys more successfully fight ransomware and other advanced threats.
Another promising development is cognitive technology, which IBM has recently brought into the security space with Watson for Cyber Security.
