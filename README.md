# Cyber Threat Intelligence Dataset

This is a dataset repository which is used for model training, evalutaions as a part of our CTI research;

[Threat Behavior Textual Search by Attention Graph Isomorphism](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.160) (Bae et al., EACL 2024)

The dataset consists of pretraining dataset, threat reports per APT groups and a collector tool (which I use for all of this collection, needed to update new reports after our work).
