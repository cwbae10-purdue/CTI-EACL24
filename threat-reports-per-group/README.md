# Threat reports large 

This a collection of threat reports per APT group. 

 - 'our-eval-set' contains the dataset for our evaluation (section 5.2 in our paper) - this is manually verified, each .txt file contains web-links to threat report

 - we also provide the downloaded list from two websites ([MalPedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/) and [ThaiCERT](https://www.thaicert.or.th/en/homepage/)). Some report may belong to different groups (which will be not included in our eval set). Also it may include non-technical reports.
