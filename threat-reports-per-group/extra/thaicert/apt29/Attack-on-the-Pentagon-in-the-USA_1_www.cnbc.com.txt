  U.S. officials tell NBC News that Russia launched a  "sophisticated cyberattack" against the Pentagon's Joint Staff  unclassified email system, which has been shut down and taken offline for nearly two weeks.
According to the officials, the  "sophisticated cyber intrusion" occurred sometime around July 25  and affected some 4,000 military and civilian personnel who work for  the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
  Sources tell NBC News that it appears the cyberattack relied on  some kind of automated system that rapidly gathered massive  amounts of data and within a minute distributed all the  information to thousands of accounts on the Internet.
The  officials also report the suspected Russian hackers coordinated  the sophisticated cyberassault via encrypted accounts on social  media.
  The officials say its not clear whether the attack was  sanctioned by the Russian government or conducted by individuals.
But, given the scope of the attack, "It was clearly the work of a  state actor," the officials say.
  They stressed that no classified information was seized or  compromised and that only unclassified accounts and emails were  hacked.

   Almost immediately after the cyberattack was detected, the  Pentagon took the aggressive step of shutting down the entire  Joint Staff unclassified email system and Internet during its  investigation.
The system should be back online before the end  of this week.
