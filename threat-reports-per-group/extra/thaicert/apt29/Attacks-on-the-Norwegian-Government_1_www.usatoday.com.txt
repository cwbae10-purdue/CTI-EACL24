Norway’s security service says nine email accounts — including those belonging to the Labour party, the foreign ministry and defense ministry — have been targeted by hackers believed to be the same Russia-linked group blamed for breaking into Democratic National Committee computers.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg told TV 2 that the hacking is "a serious attack on our democratic institutions," although security officials say no classified material was taken.
Targets also included the Police Security Service (PST), Norway's Radiation Protection Authority and an unidentified college, Arne Christian Haugstøyl, section chief for the Police Security Service told Norway's TV2.
PST also told TV2 it believes the attack came from a hacking group known as "Cozy Bear" that is linked to the Russian Security Service, or FSB, which U.S. authorities blame for the break in of the Democratic National Committee computers last year.
The hackers were accused of "spear phishing," which aims to get sensitive information like usernames, passwords or credit card information from individuals.
PST spokesman Martin Berntsen told the Norwegian tabloid VG that the agency was warned earlier this year by a foreign agency about “targeted attacks” on the email servers.
The foreign partner was not named.
Relations between the Arctic neighbors — Norway and Russia — have been strained over the arrival of 300 U.S. Marines last month in the first stationing of foreign troops in Norway since World War II.
Marines from Camp Lejeune in North Carolina will be deployed in the Scandinavian country for a year, with the initial group rotated out after six months, Reuters reported.
