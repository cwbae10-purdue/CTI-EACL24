This activity also provides further evidence to support the existence of a flourishing relationship between these two actors.
WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot banking malware began distributing a new proxy module named shadDll to group tags (gtags) prefixed with sin and tin.
These gtags have previously been associated with LUNAR SPIDER’s BokBot (a.k.a.
IcedID) malware, which was discussed in a previous blog.
The module contains identical functionality to that of the BokBot proxy module.
The new proxy module incorporates many of the most potent BokBot features within the extensible, modular framework of the TrickBot malware.
Binary code analysis revealed that the shadDll TrickBot module is 81 percent similar to the BokBot proxy module with 99 percent confidence.
This new TrickBot module, shadDll,  is primarily responsible for performing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against web browsers on infected hosts, achieved by hooking networking functions and installing illegitimate SSL certificates.
Once the malware is able to intercept SSL traffic, it can use the various BokBot configuration entries to strategically redirect web traffic, inject code, take screenshots, and otherwise manipulate victims’ browsing experience.
The shadDll module contains typical characteristics of a TrickBot module.
More explicitly, the modules are dynamic link libraries (DLLs), they contain no TrickBot encrypted strings, and they have the standard TrickBot exports of Start, Control and Release.
Although the shadDll module contains no TrickBot-encrypted strings, it does contain strings obfuscated using the custom XOR encoding used in the BokBot proxy module.
Of particular interest is the following hard-coded distinguished name (DN) values, which are identical to the ones found within the illegitimate certificates that the BokBot proxy module uses for performing MITM attacks.

This development between WIZARD SPIDER and LUNAR SPIDER further solidifies the connection between the two groups, which stretches back to the Dyre (a.k.a.
