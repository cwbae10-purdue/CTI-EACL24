Our worldwide sensor network provides researchers at FireEye Labs with unique opportunities to detect innovative tactics employed by malicious actors and protects our clients from these tactics.
We recently uncovered a coordinated campaign targeting Internet infrastructure providers, a media organization, a financial services company, and an Asian government organization.
The actor responsible for this campaign utilized legitimate digital certificates to sign their tools and employed innovative techniques to cloak their command and control traffic.
In March of 2014, we detected Kaba (aka PlugX or SOGU) callback traffic to legitimate domains and IP addresses.
Our initial conclusion was that this traffic was the result of malicious actors ‘sleeping’ their implants, by pointing their command and control domains at legitimate IP addresses.
As this is a popular technique, we did not think much of this traffic at the time.
Further analysis revealed that the HTTP headers of the traffic in question contained a Host: entry for legitimate domains.
As we have previously observed malware families that forge their HTTP headers to include legitimate domains in callback traffic, we concluded that the malware in this case was configured in the same way.
An example of the observed traffic is as follows:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C)
As we continued to see this odd traffic throughout the summer we began a search for malware samples responsible for this behavior.
Via this research, we found a malware sample that we believe was responsible for at least some of the strange traffic that we had observed.
The identified sample had the following properties:
This sample was signed with a legitimate digital certificate from the ‘Police Mutual Aid Association’.
This certificate has a serial number of ‘06 55 69 a3 e2 61 40 91 28 a4 0a ff a9 0d 6d 10’.
Analysis of this Kaba sample revealed that it was configured to directly connect to both www.adobe.com and update.adobe.com.
Indeed, further analysis of this Kaba variant revealed that it was also configured to use specific DNS resolvers.
This sample was configured to resolve DNS lookups via Hurricane Electric’s nameservers of 216.218.130.2, 216.218.131.2, 216.218.132.2 and 216.66.1.2.
We found this interesting, so we investigated how these Hurricane Electric’s nameservers were configured.
Subsequently, we found that anyone could register for a free account with Hurricane Electric’s hosted DNS service.
Via this service, anyone with an account was able to register a zone and create A records for the registered zone and point those A records to any IP address they so desired.
The dangerous aspect of this service is that anyone was able to hijack legitimate domains such as adobe.com.
Although these nameservers are not recursors and were not designed to be queried directly by end users, they were returning results if queried directly for domains that were configured via Hurricane Electrics public DNS service.
Furthermore, Hurricane Electric did not check if zones created by their users were already been registered or are otherwise legitimately owned by other parties.
As we continued this research, we identified 21 legitimate fully qualified domain names that had been hijacked via this technique by at least one APT actor.
In addition to the adobe.com domain mentioned above, another one of the poisoned domains is www.outlook.com.
A lookup of this domain via Google’s DNS resolvers returns expected results:
$ dig +short @8.8.8.8 www.outlook.com
A quick lookup of these addresses reveal that Microsoft owns them:
157.56.240.246 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
157.56.236.102 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
157.56.240.214 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
157.56.241.102 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
157.56.232.182 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
157.56.241.118 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
157.56.240.22 | 8075 | 157.56.0.0/16 | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-A | US | MICROSOFT.COM | MICROSOFT CORPORATION
However, as recently as August 4, 2014 a lookup of the same www.outlook.com domain via Hurricane Electric’s resolvers returned entirely different results[1]:
$ dig +short @216.218.130.2 www.outlook.com
$ dig +short @216.218.131.2 www.outlook.com
$ dig +short @216.218.132.2 www.outlook.com
$ dig +short @216.66.1.2 www.outlook.com
$ whois -h asn.shadowserver.org 'origin 59.125.42.167'
3462 | 59.125.0.0/17 | HINET | TW | HINET.NET | DATA COMMUNICATION BUSINESS GROUP
Passive DNS research on the 59.125.42.167 IP address revealed that multiple APT actors have previously used this IP address.
Additional researched uncovered more Kaba samples that were configured to leverage Hurricane Electric’s public DNS resolvers.
Another sample has the following properties:
This sample is signed with a recently expired digital certificate from ‘MOCOMSYS INC’.
This certificate has a serial number of ‘03 e5 a0 10 b0 5c 92 87 f8 23 c2 58 5f 54 7b 80’.
This sample used Hurricane Electric’s public DNS resolvers to route traffic to the hijacked domains of www.adobe.com and update.adobe.com.
We also noted that this sample was configured to connect directly to 59.125.42.168 – one IP address away from the IP that received traffic from the hijacked www.outlook.com domain.
Passive DNS research revealed that this IP hosted the same set of known APT domains listed above:
While this problem does not directly impact users of www.adobe.com, www.outlook.com, or users of the other affected domains, it should not be dismissed as inconsequential.
Actors that adopt this tactic and obfuscate the destination of their traffic through localized DNS hijacks can significantly complicate the job of network defenders.
Via our sensor network, we observed the actor responsible for this activity conducting a focused campaign.
We observed this actor target:
Google Code Command and Control
Furthermore, we also discovered this same actor conducting a parallel campaign that leveraged Google Code for command and control.
On August 1, 2014 we observed a malicious self-extracting executable (aka sfxrar) file downloaded from 211.125.81.203.
This file had the following properties:
A valid certificate from ‘QTI INTERNATIONAL INC’ was used to sign this sfxrar.
This certificate had a serial number of ‘2e df b9 fd cf a0 0c cb 5a b0 09 ee 3a db 97 b9’.
The sfxrar contained the following files:
Setup.exe is a legitimate executable from Kaspersky used to load the Kaba (aka PlugX) files – msi.dll and msi.dll.dat.
These Kaba files are configured to connect to Google Code – specifically code.google.com/p/udom/.
On August 1, this Google Code project contained the encoded command “DZKSGAAALLBACDCDCDOCBDCDCDOCCDADIDOCBDADDZJS”.
for x in range(0, len(s), 2):
tmp0 = (ord(s[x+1]) - 0x41) << 4
rvalue += chr(ord(s[x]) + tmp0 - 0x41)
The command ‘DZKSGAAALLBACDCDCDOCBDCDCDOCCDADIDOCBDADDZJS’ decodes to 222.122.208.10.
In a live environment, the Kaba implant would then connect to this IP address via UDP.
Further analysis of project at code.google.com/p/udom/ revealed the project owner, 0x916ftb691u, created a number of other projects.
We decoded the commands hosted at these linked projects and found that they issued the following decoded commands:
It is likely that other yet to be discovered Kaba variants are configured to connect to these related Google Code projects and then redirect to this list of IP addresses.
Passive DNS analysis of these IP addresses revealed connections to the following known malicious infrastructure:
As mentioned above the Kaba variant eae0391e92a913e757ac78b14a6f079f shared a common import hash of f749528b1db6fe5aee61970813c7bc18 with many of the samples listed in this post.
This samples was to use Hurricane Electric’s nameservers as well as connect directly to the IP address 59.125.42.168.
Note that we identified the same C2 IP 59.125.42.168 via our analysis of the malicious Google Code projects.
Specifically, the Google Project at code.google.com/p/tempzz/, which is linked to the project at code.google.com/p/udom/, issued an encoded command that decoded to 59.125.42.168.
We also identified another related Kaba variant that connected to code.google.com/p/updata-server.
This variant had the following properties:
This sample was signed with a valid digital certificate from ‘PIXELPLUS CO., LTD’ and had a serial number of ‘0f e7 df 6c 4b 9a 33 b8 3d 04 e2 3e 98 a7 7c ce’.
In addition to sharing the same Import hash of f749528b1db6fe5aee61970813c7bc18 seen in other samples listed throughout this post, 50af349c69ae4dec74bc41c581b82459 contained a RT_VERSION resource of 9dd9b7c184069135c23560f8fbaa829adc7af6d2047cf5742b5a1e7c5c923cb9.
This same RT_VERSION was used in a number of other related samples including:
These coordinated campaigns demonstrate that APT actors are determined to continue operations.
As computer network defenders increase their capabilities to identify and block these campaigns by deploying more advanced detection technologies, threat actors will continue to adopt creative evasion techniques.
We observed the following evasion techniques in these campaigns:
While none of these techniques are necessarily new, in combination, they are certainly both creative and have been observed to be effective.
Although the resultant C2 traffic can be successfully detected and tracked, the fact that the malware appears to beacon to legitimate domains may lull defenders into a false sense of security.
Network defenders should continue to study the evolution of advanced threat actors, as these adversaries will continue to evolve in pursuit of their designated objectives.
