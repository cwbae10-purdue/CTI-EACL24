Here is a summary of some of the key details about some of the LockerGoga TC/R attack attacks we have been observing:
Caused the temporary shutdown of production networks, forcing companies to switch to manual operations and procedures.
The financial impact for one of the largest targets, Norsk Hydro, is estimated to be between US$35 million and $41 million [5].
Unconfirmed; possibly a phishing email campaign containing specially crafted Microsoft Word documents or RTF attachments with macro/OLE content.
LockerGoga is currently attributed to the FIN6 malicious threat actor [13].
In addition to industrial/manufacturing companies, the malicious threat actor is also known to target healthcare and insurance companies in the US and Asia [15].
LockerGoga payloads are signed with a valid digital certificate issued by multiple certificate authorities (CA) – namely Alisa Ltd., Kitty Ltd., and Sectigo and Mikl Limited – which allowed the LockerGoga TC/R attacks to evade detection.
Some LockerGoga variants are also known to leverage the ‘taskkill’ command to disable antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection processes [6].
Some variants of the LockerGoga TC/R attack are capable of deleting windows event logs using wevtultil.exe [3].
Most likely required operator placement, with the LockerGoga malicious threat actors observed moving the payload around the network using SMB [7].
In some incidents, the actors have also been using Active Directory management services to distribute the payload in the network.
Specifically, the malicious binaries were believed to be distributed using the NETLOGON directory of the Domain Admin Group account which allowed the binaries to automatically propagate (more details below) [11].
At a high level, the LockerGoga TC/R attacks aim at encrypting files with the extensions: .doc, .dot, .docx, .docb, .dotx, .wkb, .xlm, .xml, .xls, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltx, .xlsb, .xlw, .ppt, .pps, .pot, .ppsx, .pptx, .posx, .potx, .sldx, .pdf, .db, .sql, .cs, .ts, .js, and .py.
The attacks use the embedded RSA-1024 public key in the binaries to encrypt the AES-256 key used to encrypt the individual files.
The encrypted files are stored with extension *.LOCKED.
Besides encrypting files, some LockerGoga variants include code that actually made it harder for the victims to pay ransom.
This is done by changing administrator passwords and logging users off using logoff.exe (see below).
This indicates that the attackers objectives’ may have included additional goals that are not part of a traditional ransomware modus operandi, such as cyber sabotage.
While the known variants of LockerGoga do not appear to include code to enable lateral movement, according to NorCert, the threat actors were able to move laterally, infecting the entire organization.
It is also possible that the threat actors created a new logon script and added a new logon GPO entry to execute the binary on all of the systems applying the logon script to the organizational unit or the complete organization (see Figure 4).
As soon as the endpoint is infected with the LockerGoga TC/R attack payload, the payload is moved to %TEMP% directory and executes a master/parent process which enumerates files on the endpoint and spawns slave/child processes to encrypt the individual files [8].
A high number of worker processes is known to be spawned by this threat in order to leverage additional CPU resources available on targets with multiple processors/cores.
LockerGoga variants are known to modify the password of the administrator accounts to [email protected] and run logoff.exe in order to force a log off of the users and locking them out.
LockerGoga also enumerates all the Ethernet and wireless interfaces on the endpoint and disables them using the CreateProcessW function via command line (netsh.exe interface set interface DISABLE) to isolate the endpoint [9].
Some LockerGoga variants are known to utilize trivial defense evasion techniques, including basic anti-VM and anti-sandbox mechanisms in a virtual environment, by leveraging functions like GetLastError(), IsDebuggerPresent, and OutputDebugStringA() [4].
As mentioned earlier, the LockerGoga binaries are signed by a valid certificate issued by a legitimate CA.
Many variants use the ‘taskkill’ command to terminate AVassociated processes and also attempt to clear windows logs using the ‘C:\Windows\ system32\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Trace’ command [3].
LockerGoga is also known to use some undocumented Window API calls (NtQuerySection) and import WS2_32.dll to support process communications, which shows the level of sophistication of the actors [7].
Here are some sample Securonix Spotter search queries to assist with detection of the existing infections.
(rg_category contains “Endpoint” OR rg_category contains “ips” OR rg_category contains “ids”) AND (sourceprocessname starts with tgytutrc)
Some high-level examples of the relevant Securonix behavior analytics and predictive indicators that could help detect such attacks in your IT/OT environments are given below.
Figures 4 and 5 show a practical example of the detection of the LockerGoga attacks using Securonix.
Suspicious Process Activity - Potential Sysvol/Netlogon Lateral Movement Execution Analytic
This can be leveraged to detect the lateral movement of the malicious LockerGoga implants associated with netlogon, for example gpscript execution, to help cover both the current LockerGoga variants where operator placement is required and potentially future variants involving more automation.
Suspicious Process Activity - Peak Self Worker Process Execution Analytic
This can be used to help detect the encryption activity involving spawning a large number of worker processes to encrypt the files.
The number of LockerGoga worker processes spawned depends on the number of processors/cores.
Suspicious Process Activity - Targeted - Potential Phishing Sequence II Malicious Payload Open Browser Modality Analytic
This can be used to detect the likely initial infiltration vectors used by the malicious LockerGoga attacks.
Suspicious Process Activity - Rare Parent-Child Relationship For Host Analytic
This can help detect the initial compromise and the behaviors associated with the operator placement required for lateral propagation.
Suspicious Process Activity - Peak Netsh Execution For User Analytic
This can be utilized to identify unusual activity associated with disconnecting the network interfaces on the targets using netsh disable.
Suspicious Registry Activity - Diurnal Sysvol/Netlogon Script Changes Analytic
This can help detect initial operator placement needed for lateral movement in the form of unusual GPO sysvol/scripts registry updates associated with the logon scripts GPO changes.
And a number of other Securonix behavioral analytics and predictive indicators, including: EDR-SYM5-ERI, EDR-SYM11-ERI, SST-SYM3-BPI, WEL-TAN1-BAI, EDR-SYM7-ERI, WELOTH1- RUN, EDR-SYM21-RUN, SST-SYM3-BPI et al.
