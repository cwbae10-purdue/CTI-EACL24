The Lazarus Group hacking operation, thought to be controlled by the North Korean government, has a new malware toy to pitch at potential targets and the US is getting worried about it.
This according to a report from US-Cert, which say that the group (also known as "Hidden Cobra") has a new piece of spyware capable of securely connecting to a control server and uploading pilfered files from infected machine.
Known as "Hoplight," the malware is a collection of nine files, though most of those are designed to work as obfuscation layers to keep admins and security software from spotting the attack.
"Seven of these files are proxy applications that mask traffic between the malware and the remote operators," US-Cert said in its write-up of the new Nork nasty.
"The proxies have the ability to generate fake TLS handshake sessions using valid public SSL certificates, disguising network connections with remote malicious actors."
Below those seven proxy layers, Hoplight uses its valid SSL certificate to create the secure connection, then a final, ninth file looks to create an outbound connection to the control server in order to transmit pilfered information.
The certificate looks to be a public SSL cert from Naver, a Korean search engine and service provider.
Within the bundle of files, US-Cert says, the malware package is able to perform a number of remote control and spyware activities.
This includes the ability to read and write local files, create, terminate, or modify running processes and registry settings, and connect to a remote host to upload and download files.
The Lazarus Group is something of an oddity in the world of government-backed hacking groups.
Unlike other state-sponsored operations, the primary focus of the group has not been espionage or intellectual property theft, but rather financial crime aimed at helping the isolated nation get cash into its coffers.
Lazarus/Hidden Cobra was also famously credited with pulling off the high-profile 2014 attack on Sony Pictures.
The group has typically used spear-phishing techniques to get its malware onto foreign foreign targets, and US-Cert recommends admins and users take basic security measures (such as patching systems regularly and maintaining up-to-date malware protections) in order to safeguard from attacks.
Sponsored Deciding that running your database in the cloud make sense, is easy enough.
Afterall, who would balk at the prospect of virtually unlimited scale, high availability, performance at internet scale, and the ability to tap multiple database management systems.
And that’s before the prospect of never having to worry about falling foul the licensing police ever again.
But it’s the not the nature of the destination that usually prevents people heading to the cloud.
It’s worrying about how they get there.
Bork – our column of reader-submitted unhappy displays – is celebrating 30 years of Microsoft Money this month with an example of why Windows, .NET and ATMs do not make good bedfellows.
Spotted by Register reader Sam Thompson in the delightful UK city of York (home of the Jorvik Viking Centre and the excellent National Railway Museum), the only thing being dispensed by this cash dispenser is the finest Microsoft-infused bork.
Dell revealed its latest refresh for its Dell EMC Poweredge servers yesterday, emphasizing their small size and reduced latency for uses in places like hospitals, retail space or offices.
Designed for small and medium-sized businesses, the new range, which includes the T150, T550, T350, R250 and R350, is marketed for use either in edge environments, or in a data center.
IT manager, take your pick.
Surprising nobody, the new entry-level servers use Intel Xeon processors, E-2300 processors to be exact.
They are also equipped with what Dell calls "office-friendly acoustics and thermals", but the thing Dell seems proudest of is its shrinking of T350, which is 37 per cent smaller than its predecessor.
Iran, Turkey and both North and South Korea are bases for nation-state cyber attacks, Microsoft has claimed – as well as old favourite Russia.
While more than half of cyberattacks spotted by Redmond came from Russia, of more interest to the wider world is information from the US megacorp's annual Digital Defence Report about lesser-known nation state cyber-attackers.
"After Russia, the largest volume of attacks we observed came from North Korea, Iran and China; South Korea, Turkey (a new entrant to our reporting) and Vietnam were also active but represent much less volume," said MS in a post announcing its findings.
The developers behind popular language education app Duolingo are setting their sights on maths education.
According to an interview with the BBC, founder and chief executive Luis von Ahn sees his company's approach to gamifying education as a way of getting children off distracting social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram.
"But the problem with smartphones is they are a double-edged sword – they also come with interruptive things, like TikTok,” he told the licence fee-funded broadcaster.
A British VoIP firm has staggered back to its feet after being smacked with a series of apparent DDoSes a month after suffering a series of sustained attacks it said were delivered by the REvil ransomware gang.
In an update at 11:56 UK time, it said it was "continuing to suffer from large scale DDoS attacks.
VoIP Unlimited engineers are continuing to mitigate the impact on services."
Voip Unlimited's services went down in September at the time of the initial attack, with managing director Mark Pillow saying at the time he was "extremely sorry for all inconvenience caused".
Citizens in Wales are set to be required to comply with COVID-19 passport rules to attend mass events, partly because of an apparent technical glitch in the UK nation's Parliament or Senedd Cymru, in Welsh.
A member by the name of Gareth Davies issued a furious statement [JPG] on Twitter, appearing to blame the institution's IT department for stripping him of his suffrage on an issue of national importance.
In Davies' absence, the controversial vote was carried 28-27 in favour of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations.
Under the rules, all over-18s would need a COVID Pass to enter nightclubs, indoor, non-seated events for more than 500 people, such as concerts or conventions, outdoor non-seated events for more than 4,000 people and any setting or event with more than 10,000 people in attendance.
A negative lateral flow test (aka rapid antigen test) result within the last 48 hours would also count.
RISC-V looks set to be extended to bring more computing power to applications on smaller devices.
The Zve collection of software instructions, right now under public review, provide vector math processing for embedded devices and microcontrollers.
RISC-V is an open-source, royalty-free instruction set architecture for CPU cores: RISC-V International sets the spec, and semiconductor designers are free to implement it as they see fit in their processors and system-on-chips.
Mozilla is trialling personalised advertising in its Firefox Suggest feature, along with sponsored search results, with users told that it "helps fund Firefox development."
Firefox Suggest was first introduced last month in Firefox 92, billed as "a new discovery feature that is built directly into the browser."
The feature provides links as the user types in the search bar, which can be based on local browsing history, bookmarks and open tabs, or on "sponsored suggestions from vetted partners."
Currently, users outside the US only see these uncontentious local prompts.
Something for the Weekend, Sir?
Look deep into my soil.
Hold it, feel it, smell my soil.
Like you, the sub-editors au Centre Vautour have assumed a spelling error – or at least a smelling error – and are about to correct it.
Me too: it's the first thing that popped into my head when reading about a subscription box service called "Mind, Body & Soil".
I was relieved to learn that it's a bad pun for a product promoting better mental health through gardening.
My diseased mind – certainly not yours, of course!
– mistook plant care for scatology on the balance of one innocent homonym.
I am turning into one of those desperate internet twonks who jump on every word and deliberately misinterpret everyone just so that I can trollsplain them.
Episode 18 A lesson I learned a long time ago was: never let a user buy a server.
It's not a hard lesson to remember because of the frequent booster-shots for the rule whenever some purchasing person decides to sidestep their purchasing restrictions by "renaming" what they're buying.
