The DarkHotel threat actors have been known to operate for a decade now, targeting thousands of businesses across the world via Wi-Fi infrastructure in hotels.
Our threat researchers have come across a very particular DarkHotel attack known as Inexsmar, which appears to mark a significant departure from the APT group’s traditional modus operandi.
This sample dates back to September 2016 and seems to be used in a campaign that targets political figures rather than the usual  corporate research and development personnel, CEOs and other senior corporate officials.
This attack uses a new payload delivery mechanism rather than the consecrated zero-day exploitation techniques, blending social engineering with a relatively complex Trojan to infect its selected pool of victims.
