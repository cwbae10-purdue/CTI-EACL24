        A little tool to play with Windows security
mimikatz is a tool I've made to learn C and make somes experiments with Windows security.
It's now well known to extract plaintexts passwords, hash, PIN code and kerberos tickets from memory.
mimikatz can also perform pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket or build Golden tickets.
Crypto, Terminal Server, Events, ... lots of informations in the GitHub Wiki https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki or on https://blog.gentilkiwi.com (in French, yes).
If you don't want to build it, binaries are availables on https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases
mimikatz is in the form of a Visual Studio Solution and a WinDDK driver (optional for main operations), so prerequisites are:
mimikatz uses SVN for source control, but is now available with GIT too!
You can use any tools you want to sync, even incorporated GIT in Visual Studio 2013 =)
With this optional MSBuild platform, you can use the WinDDK build tools, and the default msvcrt runtime (smaller binaries, no dependencies)
For this optional platform, Windows Driver Kit 7.1 (WinDDK) - http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=11800 and Visual Studio 2010 are mandatory, even if you plan to use Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 after.
mimikatz project is available on AppVeyor - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gentilkiwi/mimikatz

mimikatz needs coffee to be developed:
This is a personal development, please respect its philosophy and don't use it for bad things!
