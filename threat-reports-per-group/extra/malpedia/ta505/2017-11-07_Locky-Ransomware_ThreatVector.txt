Apparently Locky always comes back.
A persistent threat, Locky ransomware apparently has no plans of disappearing anytime soon.
Locky has caused issues recently when it was used to attack Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center during February 2016 where it claimed nearly 400,000 victims in the very first week of its detection.
It was about this time that we first looked at Locky.
The largest publicly admitted ransom was paid by the Hollywood Hospital, $17,000 in Bitcoin.
The second largest sum was $1,600 in Bitcoin paid by the Methodist Hospital.
Since then, we have seen a lot of variants of the ransomware, named for the file extensions given to the encrypted files.
Other variants we’ve seen have included zepto, thor, and osiris.
Endpoint security is improving by the day but so are cybercriminals; this makes detecting the criminals a never-ending game of cat and mouse.
It is often found that malware authors proactively monitor the detection rates of their product, allowing them to stay one step ahead of AV vendors by making improvements to their code to avoid detection.
In some cases, authors can make small changes in their code to keep their malware as dangerous to the end user as it was the day they released it.
This appears to be the case the case with the Locky ransomware.
This old malware didn’t need to have anything new, as the authors behind Locky just had to tweak the only part of the process that can never be fixed - the end user.
The most recent change for Locky came as one of the most popular ways to spread malware: spear phishing emails.
In this blog post, a VBS file archived via zip is dissected showing the techniques used by threat actors to avoid detection.
The original command-and-control server (C2) at the time of this writing is down, so I will be using INetSim to simulate the C2.
INetSim is a Linux tool used to emulate common Internet services such as HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and many others.
Implemented on a REMnux virtual machine in our lab environment, INetSim will serve as a fake DNS server.
This allows for the VBS script to connect to its C2 at atesbocegianaokulu [dot] com/y872ff2f.
Once the DNS request is made, INetSim will act as the C2 and serve the malicious payload.
The attack happens in two stages: The first stage is the spear phishing email that has a zip archive attached, pictured in Figure 1.a.
Inside the archive is a VBS file with the same name as the archive, pictured in the Figure 1.b.
Figure 1.a - Phishing Email
Figure 1.b - Zip File and VBS File
When the victim decompresses the archive, and clicks on the file, the VBS script starts to run.
The script tries to connect to the C2 and download the ransomware payload as seen in the Figure 2.a and Figure 2.b:
Figure 2.a - VBS script code: the code has two different C2s separated with a dash and the name of the payload.
If the VBS script can’t download the payload from the first C2 it tries to download it from the second one.
Figure 2.b - VBS Script Code New Name
The word “Enterprise” in Figure 2.b is used to avoid the malicious code detection by static analysis in an attempt to make the end user think that it is a valid component of some sort of enterprise utility.
At the same time, it uses the string to split the malicious instructions, the real instructions are:
Microsoft.XMLHTTP Adodb.streaM shell.Application Wscript.shell Process Get Temp Type Open Write ResponseBody Savetofile \GlNPcFUJR.exe http: //
In Figure 3, the VBS script can be seen connecting to the C2 and downloading the payload.

The script saves the second stage payload in the AppData/Local/Temp folder with a different name, then runs the malware as seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

The attack ends after encryption with the ransom message, seen below in Figure 6, then deletes itself.

Now all files on the system are encrypted with Diablo6, which we already know as Locky ransomware.
Figure 6.a shows the affected files, post-encryption, with the new Diablo6 file type.

The Locky Diablo6 Ransomware will target the following file types:
The domain dbr663dnbssfrodison[dot]net was recently created on August 1st, 2017 using the registrant email: jenniemarc(at)mail.com.
A reverse Whois Lookup on that account shows that 333 domains were registered by this email starting in 2016 and as recently as October 2017.
Some of those domains are known to be serving other families of ransomware which can be seen in the appendix.
We can use this registrant and these domains to proactively detect and prevent the download of the Locky payload.
Phishing emails can be tricky, as they’re specifically designed to trick the end user into initiating an action that they believe to be legitimate.
Whether it’s opening a malicious email attachment or entering credentials to a fake Gmail or Yahoo login page, mitigating social engineering attacks can be achieved with user education.
Below are some simple actions to take to help prevent these types of attacks:
Never open email if you don’t know the sender.
Never open a document if you don’t know where it came from.
Backup your personal information constantly.
If you use our endpoint protection product, CylancePROTECT®, you are already protected from this attack.
This is one form of many different attack patterns that we are seeing.
The threat can be distributed via HTML attachments disguised as invoices, Word documents embedded with malicious macro code or Visual Basic scripts (VBS), malicious URLs in spam emails, VBS, JS files archived via RAR, ZIP or 7ZIP, and DDE Office Documents.
