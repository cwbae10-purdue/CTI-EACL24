A wew variant of CryptoMix Clop ransomware has been distributed as a binary that is digitally signed and verified which makes it look like a legitimate executable.
In addition, CryptoMix Clop ransomware will append ‘.clop’ or ‘.ciop’ as a file extension to the encrypted file and drop a ransom note named as “CIopReadMe.txt” as shown in the following screenshot.

Upon execution, CryptoMix Clop ransomware will create and execute a batch file named ‘clearnetworkdns_11-22-33.bat’ to disable automatic startup repair, remove shadow volume copies and also resize them to clear out orphaned shadow volume copies.
