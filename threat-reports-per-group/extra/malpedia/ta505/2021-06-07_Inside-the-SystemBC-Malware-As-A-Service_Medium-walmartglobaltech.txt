SystemBC has historically been a proxy bot that has been around for sale since at least April 2019[1].
SystemBC has also been leveraged by the TrickBot crew, specifically the high profile Ryuk subgroup involved in extortion and ransomware activities[2,3].
The malware itself is pretty simplistic, although effective, but has mostly evolved into both a backdoor and proxy bot since it was first released.
Customers now access a payment system over TOR(socks5v7v2snlwr7[.
]onion) which presents a screen for building builds, the amount of builds you can buy along with the price has changed over time with the current option of buying involving 10 or 100 rebuilds.
After selecting which package you want you are given a screen with a timer and a wallet to send the payment to.
After building you get a compressed archive containing your bot, server and PHP component:
The server that actors buy the package from actually contains the builder and database which is a collective of build IDs associated with each actors purchase and build.
The stubs needed for building are also present.
This method of building is also commonly used for crypters where you create a stub which is an already compiled executable file designed to have certain pieces of it overwritten by using either tag based identifiers or offsets in the binary.
In this case it overwrites the needed configuration data in the stub files by finding the ‘BEGIN DATA’ marker and then packages them all up into a compressed archive for delivery to the buyer.
The server just needs which ports to listen on for communicating with the PHP panel as well as with the incoming bots.
Hiding behind TOR is becoming an increasingly common tactic for CyberCrime actors but it does not make them invulnerable to being found, in this case the server after TOR is 107.175.150[.]179.
From there we can recover most of the information needed for tracking the actor selling the malware and their customers, including the stub files for building:
Along with the database of customers and their builds which makes finding the actors and their panels relatively easy.
Using the current pricing structure against the database we can estimate that the actor has made over ~100k USD from just selling malware builds via this server with just the current listing in the database.
We also discovered that some of the actors clients are high profile criminals in the CyberCrime domain.
Historically proxy bots such as SystemBC have not been tracked as closely, as it hasn’t thought to be leveraged in large scale attacks, but we discovered some of the clients panels contained a significant number of bots.
Some of the groups this actor is selling to include TrickBot, QBot and IcedID.
In conjunction with the discovery of the large panels we also discovered that some of the panels the bots were being tasked with downloading CobaltStrike, for example one panel was pushing the following tasks:
Being leveraged by some large CyberCrime groups as more of a backdoor for delivering CobaltStrike makes SystemBC one more thing to look out for being installed in your environment and potentially left behind even after cleaning up the other related infections.
