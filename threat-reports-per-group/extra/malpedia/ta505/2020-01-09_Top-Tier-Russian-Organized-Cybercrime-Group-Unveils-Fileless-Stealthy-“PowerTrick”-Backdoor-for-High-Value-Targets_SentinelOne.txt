TrickBot is the successor of Dyre [1, 2] which at first was primarily focused on banking fraud in the same manner that Dyre did utilize injection systems.
TrickBot has shifted focus to enterprise environments over the years to incorporate many techniques from network profiling, mass data collection, incorporation of lateral traversal exploits.
This focus shift is also prevalent in their incorporation of malware and techniques in their tertiary deliveries that are targeting enterprise environments, it is similar to a company where the focus will shift depending on what generates the best revenue.
This research follows SentinelLabs discovery of the TrickBot Anchor malware and its nexus to the organized groups and advanced persistent threats.
After the initial stager for the “PowerTrick backdoor” is kicked off, then the actor issues the first command which is to download a larger backdoor.
This process is similar to what you see in Powershell Empire with its stager component.
PowerTrick is designed to execute commands and return the results in Base64 format, the system uses a generated UUID based on computer information as a “botID.”
The Victim data is then posted back to the controller.
PowerTrick is simply designed to execute commands and return results.
Aside from the PowerTrick backdoor, the criminal actors also commonly utilize other PowerShell utilities to do various tasks.
A frequent one utilized was ‘letmein.ps1’ which is a Powershell stager for open-source exploitation framework Metasploit.
The letmein script, in particular, is leveraged frequently to pivot the infection to another framework.
Figure 5: The actors download and execute letmein stager.
It is also used to detonate on other systems after pivoting.
Figure 6: use of network drives to download and execute the letmein stager.
The frequently used commands and actions are as follows:
Once the system and network have been profiled, the actors perform deletion operation and cleanup.
They remove any existing files that did not execute properly and move on to a different target of choice or perform lateral movement inside the environment to high-value systems such as financial gateways.
The executed tasks included a wide range of utilities such as previously shown Metasploit.
Other interesting deliveries will be discussed below:
TrickBot Anchor DNS variant [3] is frequently leveraged as an attack framework for enterprise environments.
TerraLoader variant version “6.0” with more_eggs JavaScript backdoor onboard is a deployed payload, often in addition to the aforementioned Anchor DNS variant on the same systems.
Direct shellcode execution is a methodology for payload deployment via a hexlified parameter.
This is something we have observed frequently where the actors will modify or create new delivery systems in order to bypass restrictions and security controls.
The PowerTrick session is initialized with the following command:
After PowerTrick is successfully executed, a child PowerShell process is created and the attacker issues a series of commands in an effort to choose an existing directory on the system.
The PowerShell task parent window name was OleMainThreadWndName, while the child had the normal name C:windowsSystem32WindowsPowerShellv1.0powershell.exe.

In the era of interconnectivity, when markets, geographies, and jurisdictions merge in the melting pot of the digital domain, the perils of the threat ecosystem become unparalleled.
Crimeware families achieve an unparalleled level of technical sophistication, APT groups are competing in fully-fledged cyber warfare, while once decentralized and scattered threat actors are forming adamant alliances of operating as elite corporate espionage teams.
