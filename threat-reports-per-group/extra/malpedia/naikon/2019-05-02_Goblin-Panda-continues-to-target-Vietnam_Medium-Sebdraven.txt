Chinese actors have changed the rtf exploit following my different articles and Anomali article https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain
But In march a researcher of Anomali @aRtAGGI made a link very interesting between Icefog and an article targeting Mongelian speaker https://threatrecon.nshc.net/2019/04/30/sectorb06-using-mongolian-language-in-lure-document/
I decide to reanalyze the RTF exploit.
It’s the same techniques, they have just change the XORing and the exploit body to bypass the yara rules which have been published.
After a new rule and retro hunting, I found a new RTF file 81f75839e6193212d71d771edea62430111482177cdc481f4688d82cd8a5fed6 exploiting the same RTF vulnerability CVE-2017–11882 and drops two files
The backdoor is the DLL and has as usual, the malware is executing using the side loading.
The dll is a variant of the newcoreRAT with many similarities with 05d0ad2bcc1c6e2752a231bc36d07a841f075a0a32a3a62abaafddbdafd72f62
and the RTF is a spear phishing targeting Vietnamese people.
The malware seems to compile 11 Dec 2018 and the document has created in 2019:01:18.
The C2 of the backdoor is a old domain web.hcmuafgh.com but it’s a new IP 193.29.56.62.
