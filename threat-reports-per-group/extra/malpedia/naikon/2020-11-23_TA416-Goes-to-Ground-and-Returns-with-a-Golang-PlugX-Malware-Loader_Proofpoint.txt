Following the Chinese National Day holiday in September, Proofpoint researchers observed a resumption of activity by the APT actor TA416.
Historic campaigns by this actor have also been publicly attributed to “Mustang Panda” and “RedDelta”.
This new activity appears to be a continuation of previously reported campaigns that have targeted entities associated with diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party, as well as entities in Myanmar.
The targeting of organizations conducting diplomacy in Africa has also been observed.
Proofpoint researchers have identified updates to the actor’s toolset which is used to deliver PlugX malware payloads.
Specifically, researchers identified a new Golang variant of TA416’s PlugX malware loader and identified consistent usage of PlugX malware in targeted campaigns.
As this group continues to be publicly reported on by security researchers, they exemplify a persistence in the modification of their toolset to frustrate analysis and evade detection.
While baseline changes to their payloads do not greatly increase the difficulty of attributing TA416 campaigns, they do make automated detection and execution of malware components independent from the infection chain more challenging for researchers.
This may represent efforts by the group to continue their pursuit of espionage objectives while maintaining an embattled toolset and staying out of the daily Twitter conversation popular amongst threat researchers.
After nearly a month of inactivity following publications by threat researchers, Proofpoint analysts have identified limited signs of renewed phishing activity that can be attributed to the Chinese APT group TA416 (also referred to as Mustang Panda and RedDelta) 1.
Recorded Future researchers have previously noted historic periods of dormancy following disclosure of TA416’s targeted campaigns.2 This most recent period of inactivity encompassed September 16, 2020 through October 10, 2020.
Notably this time period included the Chinese National holiday referred to as National Day and the following unofficial vacation period “Golden Week”.
This confluence of themed social engineering content suggests a continued focus on matters pertaining to the evolving relationship between the Catholic Church and the “CCP”.
Proofpoint researchers identified two RAR archives which serve as PlugX malware droppers.
One of these files was found to be a self-extracting RAR archive.
For the purposes of this analysis the self-extracting archive file AdobelmdyU.exe|930b7a798e3279b7460e30ce2f3a2deccbc252f3ca213cb022f5b7e6a25a0867 was examined.
The initial delivery vector for these RAR archives could not be identified.
However, historically TA416 has been observed including Google Drive and Dropbox URLs within phishing emails that deliver archives containing PlugX malware and related components.
Once the RAR archive is extracted four files are installed on the host and the portable executable Adobelm.exe is executed.
A legitimate Adobe executable used in the DLL Side-Loading of Hex.dll.
An unused binary that has been previously observed in malicious RAR archives linked to TA416.
A Golang binary which decrypts and loads adobeupdate.dat (the PlugX payload).
 The encrypted PlugX malware payload.
Figure 1: PlugX Malware Execution Diagram
Following RAR extraction, Adobelm.exe, a legitimate PE that is used for the DLL side-loading of hex.dll, is executed.
It calls a PE export function of hex.dll named CEFProcessForkHandlerEx.
Historically, TA416 campaigns have used the file name hex.dll and the same PE export name to achieve DLL side-loading for a Microsoft Windows PE DLL.
These files served as loaders and decryptors of encrypted PlugX malware payloads.
The file would read, load, decrypt, and execute the PlugX malware payload (regularly named adobeupdate.dat, as it is in this case).
The PlugX malware loader found in this case was identified as a Golang binary.
Proofpoint has not previously observed this file type in use by TA416.
Both identified RAR archives were found to drop the same encrypted PlugX malware file and Golang loader samples.
The Golang loader has a compilation creation time that dates it to June 24, 2020.
However, the command and control infrastructure discussed later in this posting suggests that the PlugX malware payload and Golang loader variant were used after August 24, 2020.
Despite the file type of the PlugX loader changing, the functionality remains largely the same.
It reads the file adobeupdate.dat, retrieves the XOR key beginning at offset x00 and continues until it reads a null byte.
It then decrypts the payload, and finally executes the decrypted adobeupdate.dat.
This results in the execution of the PlugX malware payload which ultimately calls out to the command and control IP 45.248.87[.]162.
The following registry key is also created during this process which runs at startup establishing the malware’s persistence.
Notably the sample uses the distinct file installation directory “AdobelmdyU”.
Figure 2: PlugX malware Registry Key established for malware persistence.
The PlugX malware payload, unlike the Golang loader variant, seems to remain consistent when compared with previous versions.
Historical analysis conducted by Avira and Recorded Future has documented that the encrypted PlugX payloads, which have been disguised as data and gif files, are in fact encrypted PE DLL files.
These encrypted files contain a hardcoded XOR decryption key that begins at offset x00 and continues until a null byte is read.4 In this case the Golang Binary PlugX loader reads the encryption key in the same manner from x00 to null byte, with the hardcoded key ending at offset x09.
This represents continued usage of an anti-analysis method which makes the execution of PlugX payloads more complex and complicates the detection of command and control infrastructure which the malware communicates with.

 Figure 4: PlugX malware byte sequence and hardcoded XOR decryption key.
Following decryption, the resulting file reflects a valid PE header for the PlugX malware payload.
Shellcode appears between the MZ header and the DOS message.
The function of this shellcode is to write the PE DLL into RWX memory and begin execution at the beginning of the file.
This establishes an entry point for the payload and prevents an entry point not found error when executing the malware.
This is a common technique observed by many malware families and is not exclusive to TA416 PlugX variants.
This shellcode is unlikely to appear in legitimate software DLLs.Figure 5: PlugX malware byte sequence and XOR decryption key.
The command and control communication observed by these PlugX malware samples are consistent with previously documented versions.
The C2 traffic was successfully detected by an existing Proofpoint Emerging Threats Suricata signature for PlugX malware which is publicly available as part of the ET OPEN public ruleset.5 The following IP and example command and control communication URLs were identified:
Further research regarding the command and control IP indicated that it was hosted by the Chinese Internet Service Provider Anchnet Asia Limited.
It appeared to be active and in use as a command and control server from at least August 24, 2020 through September 28, 2020.
It is notable that this time period predates the period of dormancy discussed above that likely resulted from Recorded Future’s publication on TA416 activity.
Additionally, it indicates that this server ceased being used during this dormancy period possibly indicating an infrastructure overhaul by actors during this time.
 Figure 6: RiskIQ data indicating TA416 command and control server’s period of activity.
Continued activity by TA416 demonstrates a persistent adversary making incremental changes to documented toolsets so that they can remain effective in carrying out espionage campaigns against global targets.
The introduction of a Golang PlugX loader alongside continued encryption efforts for PlugX payloads suggest that the group may be conscious of increased detection for their tools and it demonstrates adaptation in response to publications regarding their campaigns.
These tool adjustments combined with recurrent command and control infrastructure revision suggests that TA416 will persist in their targeting of diplomatic and religious organizations.
While the specifics of the tools and procedures have evolved it appears their motivation and targeted sectors likely remain consistent.
TA416 continues to embody the persistent aspect of “APT” actors and Proofpoint analysts expect to continue to detect this activity in the coming months.
