The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to a recent threat actor’s cyberattack on a federal agency’s enterprise network.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: AA20-268A.stix.
CISA became aware—via EINSTEIN, CISA’s intrusion detection system that monitors federal civilian networks—of a potential compromise of a federal agency’s network.
In coordination with the affected agency, CISA conducted an incident response engagement, confirming malicious activity.
The following information is derived exclusively from the incident response engagement and provides the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as indicators of compromise that CISA observed as part of the engagement.
The cyber threat actor had valid access credentials for multiple users’ Microsoft Office 365 (O365) accounts and domain administrator accounts, which they leveraged for Initial Access [TA0001] to the agency's network (Valid Accounts [T1078]).
First the threat actor logged into a user’s O365 account from Internet Protocol (IP) address 91.219.236[.
]166 and then browsed pages on a SharePoint site and downloaded a file (Data from Information Repositories: SharePoint [T1213.002]).
The cyber threat actor connected multiple times by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) from IP address 185.86.151[.
]223 to the victim organization’s virtual private network (VPN) server (Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190]).
CISA analysts were not able to determine how the cyber threat actor initially obtained the credentials.
It is possible the cyber actor obtained the credentials from an unpatched agency VPN server by exploiting a known vulnerability—CVE-2019-11510—in Pulse Secure (Exploitation for Credential Access [T1212]).
In April 2019, Pulse Secure released patches for several critical vulnerabilities—including CVE-2019-11510, which allows the remote, unauthenticated retrieval of files, including passwords.
[1] CISA has observed wide exploitation of CVE-2019-11510 across the federal government.
After initial access, the threat actor performed Discovery [TA0007] by logging into an agency O365 email account from 91.219.236[.
]166 and viewing and downloading help desk email attachments with “Intranet access” and “VPN passwords” in the subject line, despite already having privileged access (Email Collection [T1114], Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files [T1552.001]).
(Note: these emails did not contain any passwords.)
The actor logged into the same email account via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from IP address 207.220.1[.
]3 (External Remote Services [T1133]).
The actor enumerated the Active Directory and Group Policy key and changed a registry key for the Group Policy (Account Manipulation [T1098]).
The cyber threat actor then attempted multiple times to connect to virtual private server (VPS) IP 185.86.151[.
]223 through a Windows Server Message Block (SMB) client.
Although they connected and disconnected multiple times, the connections were ultimately successful.
During the same period, the actor used an alias secure identifier account they had previously created to log into VPS 185.86.151[.
]223 via an SMB share.
The attacker then executed plink.exe on a victim file server (Command and Scripting Interpreter [T1059]).
(plink.exe is a command-line version of PuTTy that is used for remote administration.)
The mounted file share allowed the actor to freely move during its operations while leaving fewer artifacts for forensic analysis.
Refer to Threat Actor Malware section for more information about the SSH Tunnel/reverse SOCKS proxy and inetinfo.exe.
The cyber threat actor created a local account, which they used for data Collection [TA0009], Exfiltration [TA0010], Persistence [TA0003], and Command and Control [TA0011] (Create Account [T1136]).
The cyber threat actor used the local account to:
See figure 1 for the sequence of the cyber threat actor’s tactics and techniques.
Figure 1: Cyber threat actor tactics and techniques
While logged in as “Administrator,” the cyber threat actor created two Scheduled Tasks (see table 1) that worked in concert to establish a persistent SSH tunnel and reverse SOCKS proxy.
The proxy allowed connections between an attacker-controlled remote server and one of the victim organization’s file servers (Scheduled Task/Job [T1053], Proxy [T1090]).
The Reverse SOCKS Proxy communicated through port 8100 (Non-Standard Port [T1571]).
This port is normally closed, but the attacker’s malware opened it.
Table 1: Scheduled Tasks composing SSH tunnel and reverse SOCKS proxy
This task created a persistent SSH tunnel to attacker-controlled remote server 206.189.18[.
]189 and employed port forwarding to allow connections from the remote server port 39999 to the victim file server through port 8100.
This task was run daily.
ShellExperienceHost.exe is a version of plink.exe, a command-line version of PuTTy that is used for remote administration.
This task is a reverse SOCKS proxy that is preconfigured to bind to and listen on TCP port 8100.
WinDiag.exe received responses through the SSH tunnel and forwarded the responses through port 8100 to the VPS IP address 185.193.127[.
This task was run on boot.
WinDiag.exe had compile information that matched the VPS login name
The threat actor created a Scheduled Task to run inetinfo.exe (Scheduled Task/Job [T1053]).
inetinfo.exe is a unique, multi-stage malware used to drop files (figure 2).
It dropped system.dll and 363691858 files and a second instance of inetinfo.exe.
The system.dll from the second instance of inetinfo.exe decrypted 363691858 as binary from the first instance of inetinfo.exe.
The decrypted 363691858 binary was injected into the second instance of inetinfo.exe to create and connect to a locally named tunnel.
The injected binary then executed shellcode in memory that connected to IP address 185.142.236[.
]198, which resulted in download and execution of a payload.
Figure 2: Dropper malware inetinfo.exe
The cyber threat actor was able to overcome the agency’s anti-malware protection, and inetinfo.exe escaped quarantine.
CISA analysts determined that the cyber threat actor accessed the anti-malware product’s software license key and installation guide and then visited a directory used by the product for temporary file analysis.
After accessing this directory, the cyber threat actor was able to run inetinfo.exe (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools [T1562.001]).
PowerShell script HardwareEnumeration.ps1 created a reverse SMB SOCKS proxy that allowed connection between attacker-controlled VPS IP 185.193.127[.
]18 and the victim organization’s file server over port 443 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Power Shell [T1059.001], Proxy [T1090]).
PowerShell script HardwareEnumeration.ps1 was executed daily via a Scheduled Task (Scheduled Task/Job [T1053]).
HardwareEnumeration.ps1 is a copy of Invoke-SocksProxy.ps1, a free tool created and distributed by a security researcher on GitHub.
[3] Invoke-SocksProxy.ps1 creates a reverse proxy from the local machine to attacker infrastructure through SMB TCP port 445 (Non-Standard Port [T1571]).
The script was likely altered with the cyber threat actor’s configuration needs.
invoke-TmpDavFS.psm is a PowerShell module that creates a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) server that can be mounted as a file system and communicates over TCP port 443 and TCP port 80. invoke-TmpDavFS.psm is distributed on GitHub.
CISA analysts identified several IP addresses involved in the multiple stages of the outlined attack.
CISA recommends organizations monitor network traffic for the following unusual activity.
If network defenders note any of the above activity, they should investigate.
CISA recommends organizations implement the following recommendations to protect against activity identified in this report.
Organizations should deploy an enterprise firewall to control what is allowed in and out of their network.
If the organization chooses not to deploy an enterprise firewall, they should work with their internet service provider to ensure the firewall is configured properly.
Organizations should conduct a survey of the traffic in and out of their enterprise to determine the ports needed for organizational functions.
They should then configure their firewall to block unnecessary ports.
Organization should develop a change control process to make control changes to those rules.
Of special note, unused SMB, SSH, and FTP ports should be blocked.
CISA recommends organizations implement the following best practices.
