Cognizant can confirm that a security incident involving our internal systems, and causing service disruptions for some of our clients, is the result of a Maze ransomware attack.
Our internal security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, are actively taking steps to contain this incident.
Cognizant has also engaged with the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
We are in ongoing communication with our clients and have provided them with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and other technical information of a defensive nature.
