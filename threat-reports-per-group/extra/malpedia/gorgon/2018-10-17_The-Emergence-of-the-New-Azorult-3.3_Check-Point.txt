During the past week, Check Point Research spotted a new version of Azorult in the wild being delivered through the RIG exploit kit, as well as other sources.
Azorult is a long known information stealer and malware downloader, with this particular version being advertised in an underground forum since October 4.
The version number given to it by its authors is 3.3.
There are quite a few changes in this newly witnessed variant, the most prominent ones being a new encryption method of the embedded C&C domain string, a new connection method to the C&C and improvement of the Crypto currency wallets stealer and loader.
The timing of this update to the malware is not surprising, mainly in light of major leaks for previous versions 3.1 and 3.2, in which panel source code and binary builders were released for the public to use for free.
Check Point shared those leaks to the research community for further investigation last month.
Moreover, we have witnessed and written about another project related to Azorult, dubbed ‘Gazorp’ – a dark web binary builder that allows anyone to craft the malware’s binaries for free.
Having this in minds, it is plausible that the Azorult’s author would like to introduce new features to the malware and make it worthy as a product in the underground market.
On October 4, the following update to Azorult was advertised on the exploit.in underground forum by the user CrydBrox.
The updated version number 3.3 is shown below.

The above states the following improvements and features:
[+] Added support for stealing the following wallet credentials: BitcoinGold, electrumG, btcprivate (electrum-btcp), bitcore, Exodus Eden
[+] Cryptocurrency wallet’s stealer component has been improved.
[+] The loader component was fixed and improved, allowing bat files to be loaded and executed with no errors
[+] Lowered AV detection rate, increased successful installation rate
[+] Slight improvement in admin panel’s performance

<c></c> – the configuration part, encoded with base64
<n></n> – DLLs that Azorult copies to a new directory it creates under the %TEMP% folder.
The name of the new directory is unique for every version of Azorult (‘1M0’ in version 3.1 and ‘2fda’ in version 3.2).
In the new version, the name of the directory is generated based on the id hash of the victim’s computer.
Therefore, the name of the directory will be different for every victim.
The algorithm for generating the directory name is as follows:
The particular implementation of the hash_func method is outlined in a script, which appears in the Appendix below.
<d></d> – names of application paths that Azorult harvests data from.
The following application names are added:
The authors of Azorult fixed a bug in the loader functionality that didn’t allow the malware to load bat files and execute them successfully.
The bug was caused by wrongfully comparing the extension of the loaded file, causing the launch of all files with CreateProcessW API as executables instead of ShellExecuteExW.
In the new version, the authors fixed the comparison method to avoid this bug.
