I found a tweet from @ps66uk from on Monday morning 2019-07-10 about an open directory used in malspam to push an information stealer called AZORult.
The open directory is hosted on sfoodfeedf[.

Shown above:  The open directory at sfoodfeedf[.
@ps66uk already mentioned a file named purchase order.iso which is an ISO file containing an executable file for AZORult.
However, I found another one in the same directory named 201907060947039062.iso.
Further analysis showed it was also AZORult, like the other ISO file.

Shown above:  Getting the other ISO file.

Shown above:  Extracting the EXE file from the ISO on a Windows 7 host.
In previous AZORult infections in my lab, the malware usually deleted itself after an initial exfiltration of data.
This one repeatedly did callback traffic, and there was a .vbs file made persistent on my infected Windows host during the infection.
This is apparently a more recent variant of AZORult dubbed AZORult++ as described by Kaspersky Labs and followed-up by BleepingComputer.
It's called AZORult++ because it's now compiled in C++ after formerly being compiled in Delphi.

Shown above:  Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark.

Shown above:  TCP conversations from my infected Windows host.

Shown above:  An example of the AZORult callback traffic.

Shown above:  This AZORult EXE was compiled with C++, a characteristic of AZORult++.

Shown above:  VBS file made persistent on my infected Windows host.
Earlier this month on 2019-07-01, I saw an AZORult sample (also compiled in C++) which did the expected two HTTP post requests to exfiltrate data, then deleted itself from my infected host.
Today's example proves there can be some variation in AZORult infection activity.
