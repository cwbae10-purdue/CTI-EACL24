One thing that I’ve learned from investigating malware adversaries for over a decade is that they enjoy reusing nicknames.
An adversary that I have been tracking since February 2019 likes to use the moniker “Droid” in their Lokibot command-and-control (C2) addresses.
So begins the story of the “Pija-Droid Firefinch”.
The Pija-Droid Firefinch is a frequent flyer of Lokibot malware — an infostealer once marketed in Russian underground forums but nowadays freely available by any ne’er-do-wells brazen enough to infect computers.
It appears that this malware actor mainly targets Spanish speaking communities based on language used in their malspam lures.
The malicious email attachments are usually obscure file archive formats, perhaps utilized to circumvent AV scanners.
At MalBeacon.com, we beacon malware adversaries while they are administering botnets, revealing quite a bit of information on attackers.
We derived this adversary’s name using the following paradigm:
Pija = The Spanish word for “prick”.
Spanish is also the preferred malspam language used by the attacker.Droid = Our adversary’s moniker and a common directory found in their C2 URLs.Firefinch = A bird native to Nigeria and our attacker’s location.
Beacons indicate that this adversary uses a Windows 10 64 bit Operating System and prefers the Chrome browser when administering their botnet.
Based on source IP addresses captured in MalBeacon and enriched in Comox, we can ascertain that this actor is based in Kuje, Nigeria.
This actor seems to at times also use TunnelBear VPN software to mask their location.
Researchers with access to MalBeacon can track this actor via the tag “pija2pnirb5s17824soa7j7oc3".
The actor is currently using the Lokibot C2 at:hxxp://ceraslog[.
