Amnesty International’s report on the surveillance of HRDs in Pakistan reveals that Pakistani civil society is under attack by a malicious digital campaign.
Diep Saeeda, a well-known Pakistani HRD, has been targeted by digital attacks; the first suspicious messages received after she began campaigning for the release of “disappeared” activist Raza Khan.
Diep and other activists were targeted with extremely personalised messages that included malicious links or attachments that, when opened, would either attempt to infect their devices with malware, or direct them to fake Google or Facebook login pages designed to steal their passwords.
