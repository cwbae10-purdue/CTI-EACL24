Starting late last week, we observed a large number of scans against our WebLogic honeypots to detect if they are vulnerable to CVE-2020-14882.
CVE-2020-14882 was patched about two weeks ago as part of Oracle's quarterly critical patch update.
In addition to scans simply enumerating vulnerable servers, we saw a small number of scans starting on Friday (Oct. 30th) attempting to install crypto-mining tools [1].
On Friday, Oracle amended its patch for CVE-2020-14882 [2].
A new variation of the vulnerability (CVE-2020-14750) can be used to exploit WebLogic servers with a trivial modification of the exploit code.
Last Saturday we started seeing a campaign using a chain of Powershell obfuscated scripts to download a Cobalt Strike payload.
According to Cisco Talos Q4 2020 CTIR report, 66% of all ransomware attacks this quarter involved the use of Cobalt Strike [3].
Thus, as expected, there is a high probability ransomware gang included CVE-2020-14882 exploit in their arsenal.
The attack, as seen in Figure 1, exploits the vulnerability to execute a PowerShell payload base64-encoded.
Figure 1 - Payload delivery
Decoding the base64 content, we can find the following code.
As seen, there is another encoding layer using base64 and gzip compression.
I usually make some adjustments to the original malicious script to make it save the decoded content to a file.
So, replacing “IEX” by “$content =” and appending the script with “$content |out-file -filepath decoded_script.ps1” is enough to accomplish this result for this case.
Figure 2 - First stage decoding
Part of the resulting code is shown in Figure 3.
Notice that there is another protected code.
There is a loop decrypting each byte of the code using an XOR function with the byte 0x35.
Figure 3 - Second stage decoding
The result of this operation is a shellcode to download and execute a Cobalt Strike payload hosted at http://185[.
Figure 4 - Cobalt Strike payload download
Submitting the binary to VirusTotal, we had the following result:

Running the malicious scripts in a controlled environment, it was possible to see connections established from time to time with the C2 at http://185[.
