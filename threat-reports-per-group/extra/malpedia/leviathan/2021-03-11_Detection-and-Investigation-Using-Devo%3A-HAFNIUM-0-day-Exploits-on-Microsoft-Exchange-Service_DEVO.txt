The Devo team is made up of some of the world’s brightest minds.
Our backgrounds vary, but we’re all dedicated to producing the most innovative logging and security analytics platform on the market.
On March 2, 2021, Microsoft announced it had detected the use of multiple 0-day exploits in limited and targeted attacks of on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign—with high confidence—to HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures.
This post provides details about the attacks and valuable information compiled by the entire Devo security team.
For Devo Security Operations customers, all of the alerts shown in this post and all indicators are available in the SecOps application.
In the observed attacks, threat actors leveraged CVE-2021-26855 to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate to an Exchange server.
Additional vulnerabilities—CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065—exploit on-premises Exchange servers, giving attackers access to email accounts and allowing installation of additional malware to facilitate long-term access to victim environments.
After exploiting these vulnerabilities to gain initial access, HAFNIUM operators deployed  web shells on the compromised servers.
Web shells potentially allow attackers to steal data and perform additional malicious actions that lead to further compromise.
Here’s an example of a web shell deployed by HAFNIUM, written in ASP:
Following web shell deployment, HAFNIUM operators performed the following  post-exploitation activity:
HAFNIUM operators also were able to download the Exchange offline address book from compromised systems, which contains information about an organization and its users.
Online versions of Microsoft Exchange have not been affected by these attacks.
Here are the systems that have been hit:
Devo creates and maintains a lookup available to all domains.
It contains all IOCs  collected from multiple sources.
msfhafnium0day contains hashes, IP addresses, and filenames.
group every 5m by srcIp, url
select `lu/SecOpsAssetRole/class`(entity_sourceIP) as AssetRole // Get asset role from SecOpsRole Lookup
select peek(url, re(“[^/]+$”), 0) as resource
select ifthenelse(enrichStream_entity_sourceIP_country = “A1”, true, false) as enrichStream_entity_sourceIP_isAnonymousProxy
select “Server Software Component: Web Shell” as alertMitreTechniques
Based on the alert shipped by Azure Sentinel we can detect suspicious activity in Windows logs.
Following is a list of actions that server administrators can perform:
