For JavaScript: Copy the base64 encoded payload into the code variable below
var code = "<base64 encoded 32 bit raw shellcode>";
For VBScript: Copy the base64 encoded payload into the code variable below
Dim code: code = "<base64 encoded 32 bit raw shellcode>"
wscript.exe CACTUSTORCH.js or wscript.exe CACTUSTORCH.vbs via command line on the target, or double click on the files within Explorer.
For VBA: Copy the base64 encoded payload into a file such as code.txt
