This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework.
See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat actor techniques.
This product was written by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with contributions from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
CISA and FBI are aware of an Iran-based malicious cyber actor targeting several U.S. federal agencies and other U.S.-based networks.
Analysis of the threat actor’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicates a correlation with the group known by the names, Pioneer Kitten and UNC757.
This threat actor has been observed exploiting several publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) dealing with Pulse Secure virtual private network (VPN), Citrix NetScaler, and F5 vulnerabilities.
This threat actor used these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to targeted networks and then maintained access within the successfully exploited networks for several months using multiple means of persistence.
This Advisory provides the threat actor’s TTPs, IOCs, and exploited CVEs to help administrators and network defenders identify a potential compromise of their network and protect their organization from future attacks.

CISA and FBI are aware of a widespread campaign from an Iran-based malicious cyber actor targeting several industries mainly associated with information technology, government, healthcare, financial, insurance, and media sectors across the United States.
The threat actor conducts mass-scanning and uses tools, such as Nmap, to identify open ports.
Once the open ports are identified, the threat actor exploits CVEs related to VPN infrastructure to gain initial access to a targeted network.
CISA and the FBI have observed the threat actor exploiting multiple CVEs, including CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-11539, CVE-2019-19781, and CVE-2020-5902.
After gaining initial access to a targeted network, the threat actor obtains administrator-level credentials and installs web shells allowing further entrenchment.
After establishing a foothold, the threat actor’s goals appear to be maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.
This threat actor has been observed selling access to compromised network infrastructure in an online hacker forum.
Industry reporting indicates that the threat actor operates as a contractor supporting Iranian government interests, but the malicious activity appears to also serve the threat actor’s own financial interests.
The FBI notes this threat actor has the capability, and likely the intent, to deploy ransomware on victim networks.
CISA and FBI have observed this Iran-based threat actor relying on exploits of remote external services on internet-facing assets to gain initial access to victim networks.
The threat actor also relies heavily on open-source and operating system (OS) tooling to conduct operations, such as ngrok; fast reverse proxy (FRP); Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory browser; as well as web shells known as ChunkyTuna, Tiny, and China Chopper.
Table 1 illustrates some of the common tools this threat actor has used.
Table 1: Common exploit tools

Notable means of detecting this threat actor:
The following file paths can be used to detect Tiny web shell, ChunkyTuna web shell, or Chisel if a network has been compromised by this attacker exploiting CVE-2019-19781.
As indicated in table 2, the threat actor primarily gained initial access by using the publicly available exploit for CVE-2019-19781.
From there, the threat actor used the Citrix environment to establish a presence on an internal network server.
Table 2: Initial access techniques
After gaining initial access, the threat actor began executing scripts, as shown in table 3.
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 4 to establish persistence.
CISA observed no evidence of direct privilege escalation.
The threat actor attained domain administrator credentials on the NetScaler device via exploit and continued to expand credential access on the network.
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 5 to evade detection.
Table 5: Defensive evasion techniques
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 6 to further their credential access.
Table 6: Credential access techniques
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 7 to learn more about the victim environments.
CISA also observed the threat actor using open-source tools such as Plink and TightVNC for lateral movement.
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 8 for lateral movement within the victim environment.
Table 8: Lateral movement techniques
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 9 for collection within the victim environment.
CISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 10 for command and control (C2).
Table 10: Command and control techniques
CISA currently has no evidence of data exfiltration from this threat actor but assesses that it was likely due to the use of 7-Zip and viewing of sensitive documents.
CISA and FBI recommend implementing the following recommendations.
To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at CyWatch@fbi.gov.
When available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact.
