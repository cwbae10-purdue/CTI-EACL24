          Netresec is an independent software vendor with focus on the network security field.
We specialize in software for network forensics and analysis of network traffic.

        Our most well known product is NetworkMiner, which is available in a professional as well as free open source version.
We also develop and maintain other software tools, such as
        CapLoader (for big pcap files) and
        RawCap (a lightweight sniffer).

        We at Netresec additionally maintain a comprehensive list of publicly available pcap files.

          NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows.
NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc.
without putting any traffic on the network.
NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files.

          CapLoader is a Windows tool designed to handle large amounts of captured network traffic in the tcpdump/libpcap format (PCAP).
CapLoader displays the contents of opened PCAP files as a list of TCP and UDP flows.
Users can select the flows of interest and quickly filter out those packets from the loaded PCAP files.
Sending the selected flows/packets to a packet analyzer tool like Wireshark or NetworkMiner is then just a mouse click away.

          PolarProxy is a transparent SSL/TLS proxy created for incident responders and malware researchers.
PolarProxy is primarily designed to intercept and decrypt TLS encrypted traffic from malware that is run in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox.
PolarProxy decrypts and re-encrypts TLS traffic, while also saving the decrypted traffic in a PCAP file.

        Additional software from Netresec can be found on our products page.


Start Menu Search Video


In this video I demonstrate that text typed into the Windows 10 start menu gets sent to Microsoft and how that traffic can be intercepted, decrypted and parsed.
The video cannot be played in your browser.
The XML files shown in the video were sent by Cortana&#39;s &#39;SmartSearch&#39; app to htt[...]


Carving Packets from Memory


Someone who says &#39;We&#39;re gonna pull the packet captures out of the router&#39; probably has no clue how to capture network traffic.
In the Lindell case, statements like these were results of an elaborate hoax.
Nevertheless, such a statement doesn&#39;t have to be nonsense â€” if it comes from someone who knows[...]


Walkthrough of DFIR Madness PCAP


I recently came across a fantastic digital forensics dataset at dfirmadness.com, which was created by James Smith.
There is a case called The Stolen Szechuan Sauce on this website that includes forensic artifacts like disk images, memory dumps and a PCAP file (well, pcap-ng actually).


NetworkMiner 2.7 Released


We are happy to announce the release of NetworkMiner 2.7 today!
The new version extracts documents from print traffic and pulls out even more files and parameters from HTTP as well as SMB2 traffic.
We have also updated our JA3 implementation to fingerprint the server side in TLS sessions using JA3S[...]


Network Forensics Classes for EU and US


We have now scheduled two new live online classes, one in September and one in October.
The September class is adapted to European time and the October one is adapted to American time.
The contents are exactly the same in both classes.
The training is split into four interactive morning sessions (4[...]


Detecting Cobalt Strike and Hancitor traffic in PCAP


This video shows how Cobalt Strike and Hancitor C2 traffic can be detected using CapLoader.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
I bet you&#39;re going: ðŸ˜± OMG he&#39;s analyzing Windows malware on a Windows PC!!!
Relax, I know what I&#39;m doing.
I have also taken the precaution of analyzing the PCAP f[...]


CapLoader 1.9 Released


A new version of the PCAP filtering tool CapLoader has been released today.
The new CapLoader version 1.9 is now even better at identifying protocols and periodic beacons than before.
The user interface has also been improved to make it easier to filter and drill down in network traffic to extract i[...]


Running NetworkMiner in Windows Sandbox


NetworkMiner can be run in a highly efficient Windows Sandbox in order to analyze malicious PCAP files in Windows without accidentally infecting your Windows PC.
This blog post shows how to set up a Windows Sandbox that always boots up a fresh install of Windows 10 with the latest version of Network[...]


Analysing a malware PCAP with IcedID and Cobalt Strike traffic


This network forensics walkthrough is based on two pcap files released by Brad Duncan on malware-traffic-analysis.net.
The traffic was generated by executing a malicious JS file called StolenImages_Evidence.js in a sandbox environment.
The capture file starts with a DNS lookup for banusdona.top, whi[...]
