This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to provide detailed analysis of three malicious ISO (optical disc image) files submitted to CISA.
These malicious files are associated with a spearphishing campaign targeting government organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations using Constant Contact to spoof a U.S. Government organization and distribute links to malicious URLs.
Two of the ISO files submitted to CISA contain a dynamic-link library that is a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader, a Portable Document Format (PDF) file, which is displayed to the target as a decoy document, and a Microsoft shortcut that executes the Cobalt Strike beacon.
The remaining file is corrupt and fails to extract PDF and LNK files.
The two Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders contain the same encoded configuration data.
The Cobalt Strike Beacon is a malicious implant on a compromised system that calls back to the attacker and checks for additional commands to execute on the compromised system.
CISA and FBI are distributing this MAR, which includes tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with this activity, to enable network defense and reduce exposure to this malicious activity.
For more information, refer to the CISA Alert AA21-148AÂ Sophisticated Actor Spearphishing Campaign Targets Government Organizations, IGOs, and NGOs.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: MAR-10339794-1.v1.stix.
This is an ISO archive file that contains three files including a malicious DLL library named "Documents.dll"(ee44c0692fd2ab2f01d17ca4b58ca6c7f79388cbc681f885bb17ec946514088c).
This DLL has been identified as a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon Version 4 implant.
The second file is a malicious shortcut file named "Reports.lnk" (48b5fb3fa3ea67c2bc0086c41ec755c39d748a7100d71b81f618e82bf1c479f0) that executes the custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader.
The third file, "ICA-declass.pdf", is a benign decoy PDF (7d34f25ad8099bd069c5a04799299f17d127a3866b77ee34ffb59cfd36e29673).
ICA-declass.pdf is a benign PDF decoy file contained within the ISO archive.
Report.lnk is a Microsoft shortcut (LNK) file.
The file was contained within the ISO archive.
The file "Report.lnk" displays a folder icon labeled "Reports" on the compromised system.
This file is a 64-bit DLL file identified as a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon Version 4 implant.
The DLL was contained within the ISO archive file "ICA-declass.iso" (2523f94bd4fba4af76f4411fe61084a7e7d80dec163c9ccba9226c80b8b31252).
The encoded configuration data for the implant is illustrated in Figure 1.
The configuration file contains the hard-coded C2s, communication protocol, and an implant watermark.
The configuration file is encoded via an XOR with the key 0x2e and a 16-bit byte swap.

Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL files "Documents.dll" (ee44c0692fd2ab2f01d17ca4b58ca6c7f79388cbc681f885bb17ec946514088c and ee42ddacbd202008bcc1312e548e1d9ac670dd3d86c999606a3a01d464a2a330) attempt to connect to the domain.
Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL files "Documents.dll" (ee44c0692fd2ab2f01d17ca4b58ca6c7f79388cbc681f885bb17ec946514088c and ee42ddacbd202008bcc1312e548e1d9ac670dd3d86c999606a3a01d464a2a330) attempt to connect to the domain.

This DLL application has been identified as a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon Version 4 implant.
The second file is a malicious shortcut file named "Reports.lnk" (48b5fb3fa3ea67c2bc0086c41ec755c39d748a7100d71b81f618e82bf1c479f0).
The shortcut executes the custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader.
The third file, "ICA-declass.pdf", is a benign decoy PDF (7d34f25ad8099bd069c5a04799299f17d127a3866b77ee34ffb59cfd36e29673).
This file is a 64-bit DLL file identified as a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon Version 4 implant.
The DLL was contained within the ISO file "ICA-declass.iso" (94786066a64c0eb260a28a2959fcd31d63d175ade8b05ae682d3f6f9b2a5a916).
The encoded configuration data for the implant is illustrated in Figure 1.
The configuration file contains the hard-coded C2s, communication protocol, and an implant watermark.
The configuration file is encoded via an XOR with the key 0x2e and a 16-bit byte swap.

This DLL application has been identified as a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon Version 4 implant.
This archive file is corrupt preventing the remaining files "ICA_DECL.PDF" and "REPORT.LNK" from being extracted.
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
