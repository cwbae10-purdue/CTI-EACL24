      For the past few years, Asia Pacific and Japan have continued to be a regular target of cyber threat actors.
From 2018 to 2019, we have observed several threats targeting Japan involving cyber espionage and underground activities.
Some of the adversaries and campaigns are revealed in OSINT, however, some are still lurking in shadow.
In this talk, we will reveal the TTP's (tactics, techniques and procedures) of espionage threat actors interested in Japanese electronics, chemical and 5G equipment manufacturing companies.
One campaign leverages a malware attributed to APT41, a prolific Chinese cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations.
Beside the Chinese actors, we have also observed a group which historically focused on the EMEA region shift to showing interest in Japan.
In addition, we will also disclose details of underground activity involving a target in the Japanese financial industry.
