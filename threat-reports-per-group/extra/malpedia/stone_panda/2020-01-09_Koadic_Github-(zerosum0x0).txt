        Koadic C3 COM Command & Control - JScript RAT
Koadic, or COM Command & Control, is a Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other penetration testing tools such as Meterpreter and Powershell Empire.
The major difference is that Koadic does most of its operations using Windows Script Host (a.k.a.
JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.
It is possible to serve payloads completely in memory from stage 0 to beyond, as well as use cryptographically secure communications over SSL and TLS (depending on what the victim OS has enabled).
Recent versions Koadic are developed on Python 3, it is not a priority to have Python 2 support (End of Life).
Stagers hook target zombies and allow you to use implants.
Implants start jobs on zombies.
