During routine hunting we stumble upon new Remote Administration Toolkit (RAT), named Venom RAT.
Like with many such tools authors are conducting their business under false pretense of providing a tool to remotely manage your own computers.
A one can see on a screen-shot above, this tool posses essential capabilities to manage your own computers such as
All those for small price of 150$ per month.
What we get for it?
This RAT is a revamped version of infamous Quasar RAT, most likely based on this fork.
Following new commands where added
On top of that an rootkit was added to help hide malicious software.
This adds following capabilities to already extensive list of what Quasar RAT can do.
Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but the way authors decide to implement it is quite shocking, as none of those extensions are part of a malware binary.
Instead new executable is downloaded from hardcoded address and run
Following code is responsible for fetching and installing DLL containing a root-kit,
Code of this rootkit can be found on github, https://github.com/bytecode77/r77-rootkit.
This rootkit will hide anything (process, files, etc) with prefix $77 hence names of running VenomRAT binaries will start with $77 this is also clearly visible in project files, for example in .csproj which is a part of every C# project and describes its basic properties.
In addition to DLL being fetched from interent, 2 more binaries are extracted form resources and dropped
Probably author’s own creation named by them as Velos Stealer is a very simple C# program capable of stealing fallowing data,
stolen data will saved into separate files (Passwords.txt, Cookies.txt, CC.txt, Autofill.txt)  and later compressed into Passwords.zip
This file its a UltraVNC, packed with UPX and wrapped into some sort of installer.
As in most cases installation will be done intermediary ad-hoc created .bat script
In order to install RDP on victims computer few scripts and binaries will be downloaded and run.
Before those files will be run, some steps are taken to prepare environment, more precisely,
Both are RDP and VNC are tunneled by ngrok.io network, in order to achieve that ngrok client is being downloaded from hxxp://91.134.207[.
]16/ngrok.exe and another utility named getrdp.exe (from hxxp://91.134.207[.
]16/getrdp.exe)4 is used to enumerate available tunnels and send that data back to c2.
getrdp.exe is a another SFX archive, this time containing curl.exe and jq.exe, both benign tools.
Authors decided to implement an unusual strategy of ex-filtrating stolen data, first a file is put onto FTP server using WinSCP client and later an email with a file attached is being send.
Credentials needed for authorization to ftp and smtp server are send in a command initiating data stealing.
In the code one can find actually two function responsible for uploading data onto FTP server, one using pure powershell and other aforementioned WinSCP.com
In similar fashion to FTP, malware has a two function for sending emails, one relaying on powershell and second on blat.exe5, powershell method will write a script into %TEMP%\send.ps1.
VenomRAT is yet another RAT published on hackforums, an infamous hatchery of incapable hackers-wannabes.
While author has some interesting ideas he’s lack of programing skills and understanding of how system and networks work prevents him from fully implement it.
Besides all of those shortcomings (or maybe due to them) it generates quite a buzz on a forum,
While Qusar RAT and it forks are used by few actors, including APT33, Dropping Elephant, Stone Panda, The Gorgon Group6, it is very unlikely that this tool will be ever used by any serious threat actor.
With a price of 150$ per month doesn’t sound like an option for aspiring criminals either, however we found quite a few samples ITW and are waiting with impatience for an upgrades that will fix all of the errors and misconceptions.
For now it just an another examples of company selling malicious software under a umbrella of elaborate TOS.

all mutexes can be described with following regex:  VNM_MUTEX_[a-zA-Z]{18}
Analysis was performed based on a debug build (7128a2488b2d0084465ca1602a844eafb191de938fc70098d86cb65d17734778) representing version 2.1.0.0, this version match all of them samples of this malware we found ITW ↩︎
This feature will be added probably in next version, for now function responsible for it is empty ↩︎
autoupdate.bat is a legitimate file, part of RDP Wrapper that will add itself as scheduled task ↩︎
