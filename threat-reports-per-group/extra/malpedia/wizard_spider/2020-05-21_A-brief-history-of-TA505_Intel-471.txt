Intel 471 has observed a greater number of compromises in government institutions at the regional, local and municipal level.
We’ve seen actors provide access to services that call victims, appear as a legitimate call from a specific bank and deceive victims into typing an OTP or other verification code into a mobile phone.

Cybercriminals look to break traditional hierarchies within Ransomware-as-a-Service groups, as new models and collaboration equals more profit.
