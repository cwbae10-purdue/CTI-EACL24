The following is an update on the status of Trickbot at noon GMT, Oct. 20, 2020.
On Oct. 19, 2020, Emotet was used to distribute Trickbot.
This is the most recent Trickbot sample Intel 471 has observed.
The following is a list of control servers included as part of this Trickbot sample’s configuration:
On Oct. 19, 2020, when this latest Trickbot sample was distributed, none of the above listed control servers were able to respond to Trickbot bot requests, a state that continued at the time of this report.
Intel 471 believes disruption operations against Trickbot are currently global in nature and have had success against Trickbot infrastructure.
Regardless, there still is a small number of working controllers based in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan that still are able to respond to Trickbot bot requests.
This small number of working control servers was not listed in the most recent distributed Trickbot sample.
