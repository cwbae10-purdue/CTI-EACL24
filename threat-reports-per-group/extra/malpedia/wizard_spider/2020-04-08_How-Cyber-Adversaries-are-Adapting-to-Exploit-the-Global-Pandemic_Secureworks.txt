The ongoing COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic is creating challenges for organizations and individuals around the world.
Most organizations have implemented remote working for their employees where possible.
This transition changes how employees access data and communicate with colleagues and customers.
That change creates an opportunity for threat actors who seek to exploit the situation for financial gain or intelligence gathering.
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers are tracking multiple coronavirus-themed campaigns across customer telemetry and third-party reporting.
As of this publication, there has not been a noticeable increase in detections across customers’ managed security controls since the beginning of 2020.
However, there is clear evidence of well-established cybercriminal and government-sponsored threat actors leveraging general interest in COVID-19 to entice victims to open malicious links and attachments.
CTU™ researchers have observed government-sponsored hackers weaponizing coronavirus-themed Office documents and sophisticated criminal operators targeting critical infrastructure and organizations in areas hit hard by the pandemic.
The international response to the pandemic will be the subject of intelligence focus for some countries, as they seek to understand what other countries and international organizations are doing, saying, and thinking beyond public statements.
This focus has likely shifted targeting requirements for some intelligence agencies and their associated cyberespionage operations.
For example, Iranian government-sponsored threat actors reportedly attempted to infiltrate the World Health Organization.
Meanwhile, traditional cyberespionage activity continues.
There have been many examples of government-sponsored actors incorporating the COVID-19 situation into their standard targeting operations:
Well-resourced cyberespionage groups can rapidly adapt their targeting to take advantage of emerging opportunities.
Due to public interest in COVID-19, spearphishing attacks using this theme are more likely to be successful.
It is highly likely that threat groups will also explore their targets’ increased attack surface as employees transition to working from home and the uptake in remote access and conferencing solutions continues.
Although hostile foreign intelligence services might not factor into every organization’s threat model, all organizations should consider risks posed by financially motivated cybercriminals.
Those groups have also quickly pivoted to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic:
The fundamental business model and revenue generation of these sophisticated criminal groups does not really change as a result of the global pandemic.
But fear, uncertainty, and a thirst for information about the current situation increases the number of potential victims and the likelihood of successful attacks.
Some threat actors have granted the healthcare sector a partial reprieve from this activity.
GOLD VILLAGE, which operates the Maze ransomware, stated on March 18 that it would no longer target healthcare.
However, the threat actors subsequently advertised compromised healthcare organizations.
Since March 24, the GOLD TAHOE threat group, which operates the Clop ransomware, has included a message on its public name-and-shame website that the group will not target healthcare.
It is perhaps too early to determine if there is some honor among thieves.
The activity receiving the most public attention includes spoofed domains, disruptive acts targeting remote conferencing services, and other scams.
Unlike some of the threats discussed earlier in this blog post, the challenge for security teams in these incidents is identifying the malicious activity amid the noise.
CTU researchers recommend that organizations apply the following mitigations for coronavirus-themed threats.
Many of these security practices protect organizations against other threats as well.
