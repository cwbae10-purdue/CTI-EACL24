Fully Managed Threat Hunting, Intelligence, Detection and Takedown of Threats to your brand outside your perimeter online.
Analysis and unpacking of malware in the wild to detect and takedown crimeware developed to specifically target your organisation and your customers.
Through a combined process of automated and human analysis, FraudWatch focusses on identifying all components of malware, from the drop sites and command and control servers.
We provide a fully managed service, detecting, assessing, and analysing potential threats through to the take down of malware components by our Human Analysts in our 24 X 7 Security Operations Centre (SOC).
Banking Trojan Malware silently infects end users on both mobile and desktop devices stealing account credentials unnoticed or silently hacking secure sessions.
FraudWatch employs a team of dedicated malware analysts that work alongside our SOC.
This team sources malware circulating in the wild through network relationships and data feeds.
Malware is then in unpacked and analysed to determine if it is targeting our clients.
If it is, further analysis is then performed to identify the command-and-control servers (C&C) and Credential drop sites.
FraudWatch uses expert Human Analysts on our SOC to spearhead the malware component takedown process.
We do much more than simply send an automated single email to an abuse mailbox.
Our team analyses each hosted component to determine all possible involved parties and contact them by all methods available.
We have also built relationships with hosts and registrars over the past 18 years, and in many cases have a direct reporting process for immediate takedown.
Our teams have a never give up attitude.
Once all back-end infrastructure of the malware is taken down, the malware is then inoperable, regardless of the number of devices infected – The malware simply cannot communicate and provide stolen data or credentials back to the criminals.
