      Vitali presents malware techniques and tricks on how to reverse engineer and analyze malware families exploiting active directory.
The talk dives deeper into pseudo-source code level analysis and malware developer implementation of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) harvesting techniques for lateral movement and persistence across corporate environment.
The talks explores three prolific malware families such as TrickBot, QakBot, and IcedID (BokBot) and their coding routine and patterns that are focused on collecting LDAP.
For example, TrickBot specifically grabs credential and group policy information stored in “SYSVOL” das well as searching for corporate machines for possible sensitive machines associated with possible point-of-sale terminals on domain controller.
Vitali also presents detection and mitigation methods on how to detect active directory exploitation and discusses defense mechanisms surrounding most popular active methods used in the wild by the sophisticated groups.
