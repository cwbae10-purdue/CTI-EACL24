How much is Computrace paying you?
I would love to work for them too and promote data invasion.
Hi Anonymous,why do you assume Computrace is paying me?
I didn't exactly put them in a positive spotlight.That being said, I didn't get paid anything by Computrace and to think I would is simply ridiculous.
Thank you for the detailed review Bart, I was looking for more information and you provided exactly what I needed.
Not sure what that other guy is on about, your review is pretty objective and just presents facts.
definitely not a sales pitch.
Hi Anonymous,my pleasure and thanks for your feedback!

Hi, thanks for the article.
I bought a lenovo thinkpad w520 off eBay but it has computrace.
Will changing the bios chip (by unsoldering it from the motherboard and replacing it with another w520 chip) remove computrace?
Hi Som,While I cannot confirm this will remove Computrace, it should in theory.
Note that file, folder, registry and service artifacts will still exist on your machine as well, so you may want to reinstall the operating system additionally.Regards
