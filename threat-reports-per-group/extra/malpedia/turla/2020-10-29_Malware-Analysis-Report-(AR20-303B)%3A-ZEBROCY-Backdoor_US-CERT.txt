This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF).
The malware variant, known as Zebrocy, has been used by a sophisticated cyber actor.
CISA and CNMF are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity.
This MAR includes suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Two Windows executables identified as a new variant of the Zebrocy backdoor were submitted for analysis.
The file is designed to allow a remote operator to perform various functions on the compromised system.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the CISA or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
For more information on malicious cyber activity, please visit https[:]//www[.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10310246-1.v1.
This file is a 32-bit Windows executable written using Golang programming language.
The file has been identified as a new variant of the Zebrocy backdoor.
The file takes an argument that is supposed to be an Exclusive OR (XOR) and hexadecimal encoded Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or it can run using a plaintext URI.
The encrypted data is hexadecimal encoded and stored into "%AppData%\Roaming\Personalization\EUDC\Policies\3030304332393839394630353537343934453244.”
It also collects information about the victim’s system such as username, 6 bytes of current user’s Security Identifiers (SID), and time of infection.
The data is encrypted and hexadecimal encoded before being exfiltrated using the predefined URI:
--Begin POST requests--
--Begin POST request sample--
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: www[.
The malware allows a remote operator to perform the following functions:
--Begin functions--
File manipulation such as creation, modification, and deletion
Screenshot capabilities
Drive enumeration
Command execution (using cmd.exe)
Create scheduled task for persistence
--End functions--
This file is a 32-bit Windows executable written using Golang programming language.
The file has been identified as new variant of the Zebrocy backdoor.
The file takes an argument that is supposed to be an XOR and hexadecimal encoded URI.
The file cannot run using a plaintext URI as compared to the other Zebrocy backdoor binary "ba9c59783b52b93aa6dfd4cfffc16f2b".
This file and ba9c59783b52b93aa6dfd4cfffc16f2b have similar functions.
When executed, it will encrypt the URI using AES-128 ECB algorithm with a key generated from the victim's hostname.
The encrypted data is hexadecimal encoded and stored into "%AppData%\Roaming\UserData\Multimedia\Policies\3030304332393839394630353537343934453244".

CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, "Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops".
CISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
