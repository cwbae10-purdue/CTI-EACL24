Few cybercrime groups have gained as much notoriety—both for their actions and for their mystique—as the Lazarus group.
Throughout the Lazarus group's operational history, few threat actors have managed to match the group in terms of both scale and impact, due in large part to the wide variety of tools and tactics at the group’s disposal.
The malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus’ arsenal.
This malicious software, which could have been active since late 2016, was used in a recent campaign targeting financial institutions using watering hole attacks.
The variant used during these attacks (TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools and software targeting banking systems.
We analyzed a new RATANKBA variant (BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL-A), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script instead of its more traditional PE executable form—a version that other researchers also recently identified.
We identified a number of servers Lazarus used as a backend system for temporarily holding stolen data.
We were able to access this backend, which provided us with valuable information about this attack and its victims.
Around 55% of the victims of RATANKBA’s Powershell version were located in India and neighboring countries.
This implies that the Lazarus group could be is either collecting intelligence about targets in this region, or is at an early stage of planning.
They could have also been performing exercises in preparation for an attack against similar targets.
The majority of the observed victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoft software.
Less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users, which means that currently, RATANKBA mostly affects smaller organizations or individual users, not larger organizations.
It's possible that Lazarus is using tools other than RATANKBA to target larger organizations.
Lazarus’ backend logs also record victim IP addresses.
Based on a reverse WHOIS lookup, none of the victims can be associated with a large bank or a financial institution.
However, we did manage to identify victims that are likely employees of three web software development companies in India and one in South Korea.
RATANKBA is delivered to its victims using a variety of lure documents, including Microsoft Office documents, malicious CHM files, and different script downloaders.
These documents contain topics discussing either software development or digital currencies.
The growth of cryptocurrencies may be a driving force behind the use of cryptocurrency-related lures.
An example of a lure used in a RATANKBA attack can be seen below:

Once the lure’s recipient opens and executes the file, a backdoor will be dropped into the victim’s system.
This RATANKBA backdoor is what is used to communicate with RATANKBA’s Command-and-Control (C&C) server.
We have observed two initial conversations with the C&C server (all are done via HTTP GET or POST to the server):
This means that the backdoor is responsible for both uploading victim information, as well as executing any tasks that the controller has assigned to it, which includes the following:
In addition to the backdoor’s modus operandi, the attackers will use a Microsoft WMI command-line tool to list the compromised system’s running processes, which are sent to the C&C server:
During our analysis, we collected a copy of the RATANKBA malware’s Lazarus Remote Controller tool.
The remote controller provides a user interface that allows attackers to send jobs to any compromised endpoint.
The controller gives the attackers the ability to manipulate the victims’ host by queueing tasks on the main server.
RATANKBA retrieves and executes the tasks, and retrieves the collected information.
The RATANKBA malware has a control model that does not use real-time communication between the backdoor and the attacker.
Instead, both the remote controller and the backdoor connect to its main communication control server to push or pull pieces of information.
The controller uses a graphical UI interface and can be used to push code to the server, while the backdoor regularly connects to the server to check for pending tasks.
The controller downloads the victim profiles from the server.
If the profiles are already downloaded by the controller, they are deleted from the server side.
The controller can post victim-specific tasks as well as global specific tasks to the server.
Below are the various functionalities of RATANKBA’s controller:
RATANKBA’s controllers use the “Nimo Software HTTP Retriever 1.0” user-agent string for its communication.
The communication protocol format for the controller and backdoor is as follows:
One of most notable changes on the new RATANKBA variant is that the new version was written in Powershell, whereas the original variant was in PE form.
The shift from PE to Powershell makes it more difficult for antivirus solutions to detect.
The screenshot below shows the conversion from C/C++ code to Powershell, while the protocol remained unchanged.
While we do not have any knowledge of who the actual Lazarus attackers are, the data collected from the backend systems gives us some insights into the internet usage patterns of systems likely owned by Lazarus group members.
Clues regarding the profiles of the attackers was also found, including those connected to developers and at least one operator.
All of them appear to be native Korean speakers, or at least have Korean language proficiency that is at the near-native level.
We believe at least one of them also understands Chinese.
We also observed clues that the attackers are interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ant Share (NEO).
One of them transferred shares of NEO at a good market price.

Given Lazarus’ use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it’s reasonable to assume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their malicious activities.
Overall, an organization will need multilayered security strategies, as Lazarus and other similar groups are experienced cybercriminals who employ different strategies to get past organizational defenses.
The impact of this malware can be mitigated with proven mitigation techniques such as routinely scanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and spreading through an organization.
In addition, educating employees and other key people in an organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for when it comes to malicious attacks.
Other mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.
Trend Micro™ Deep Security™ provides virtual patching that protects endpoints from threats such as malicious redirections to malware-hosting URLs as well as those that exploit unpatched vulnerabilities.
