This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as BISTROMATH.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report looks at multiple versions of a full-featured RAT implant executable and multiple versions of the CAgent11 GUI implant controller/builder.
These samples performs simple XOR network encoding and are capable of many features including conducting system surveys, file upload/download, process and command execution, and monitoring the microphone, clipboard, and the screen.
The GUI controllers allow interaction with the implant as well as the option to dynamically build new implants with customized options.
The implants are loaded with a trojanized executable containing a fake bitmap which decodes into shellcode which loads the embedded implant.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-101265965-1.v1.stix.
The samples use a PlanetCPP.com ‘RichEdit example’ executable to obfuscate calling a decryption function which decrypts an embedded ‘fake’ bitmap image into the configuration and shellcode.
When the malicious function is called, it deobfuscates API pointers, loads the full file into memory, calculates an offset into the memory to a ‘fake’ bitmap image, decodes the image; which becomes configuration options and shellcode and then executes the shellcode.
The embedded shellcode has many selectable options.

Implants built with sample "04D70BB249206A006F83DB39BBE49FF6E520EA329E5FBB9C758D426B1C8DEC30" are not compatible with this controller, and vice versa.
See analysis for file "1ea6b3e99bbb67719c56ad07f5a12501855068a4a866f92db8dcdefaffa48a39" for additional details.

This sample varies slightly in the following ways.
Victim_info for this version contains Unicode strings.
The RAT is controllable by an unknown variant of CAgent.exe.
This sample is a GUI implant controller titled “Cyber Agent v11.0”.
The controller can establish Remote Desktop viewer, drive enumeration, file upload/download, list processes and services, reverse shell, microphone capture and recording, keylogger, browser activity, cached passwords, and DLL loading and unloading.
The controller has the ability to provide implants with an Update URL as well as an option to uninstall all bots.

Hard-coded C2 address used by these RATs.
This sample is a full-featured RAT executable contained within "1EA6B3E99BBB67719C56AD07F5A12501855068A4A866F92DB8DCDEFAFFA48A39".
See Figure 1 for full list of commands a hardcoded C2 address of 159.100.250.231 on port 8080 is contained within the sample.
The RAT is controllable by CAgent.exe variant "618A67048D0A9217317C1D1790AD5F6B044EAA58A433BD46EC2FB9F9FF563DC6".
The Imports are obfuscated by prepending "CARAT_" to the API names.
Packets are formatted in the following format:
			----------Begin Packet Formatting---------
			[OPCODE] [4 Bytes length of data] [data]
			----------Begin Packet Formatting---------
			Packets are encoded by performing an XOR on the data after the header with the XOR key 0x07.
The implant initiates callback to C2, then immediately sends its victim_info.
----------Begin Victim_Info----------
			•    Language
			•    Country
			•    Victim_ID
			•    Computer_Name
			•    User_Name
			•    Implant_Version = "11.0"
			•    Victim_IP
			•    System_Architecture
			•    Drive_Letters
			•    OS_Version
			----------End Victim_Info----------
This sample is a full-featured RAT executable contained within "B6811B42023524E691B517D19D0321F890F91F35EBBDF1C12CBB92CDA5B6DE32".

This sample varies slightly in the following ways.
The sample attempts to connect to 159.100.250.231:8080 4 times, with 1 minute between attempts.
If does not succeed, then attempts to connect to www.example.com 4 times, with 1 minute between attempts.
This loop continues until a connection is made.
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
