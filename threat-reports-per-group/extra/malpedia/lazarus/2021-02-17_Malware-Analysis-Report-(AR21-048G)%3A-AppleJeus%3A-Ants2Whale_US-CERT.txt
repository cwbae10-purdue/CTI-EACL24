This MAR highlights this cyber threat posed by North Korea and provides detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on other versions of AppleJeus and recommended steps to mitigate this threat, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-048A: AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea's Cryptocurrency Malware at https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA21-048A.
There have been multiple versions of AppleJeus malware discovered since its initial discovery in August 2018.
In most versions, the malware appears to be from a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency trading company and website, whereby an unsuspecting individual downloads a third-party application from a website that appears legitimate.
The U.S. Government has identified AppleJeus malware version—Ants2Whale—and associated IOCs used by the North Korean government in AppleJeus operations.
Ants2Whale, discovered in October 2020, is a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency trading software that is marketed and distributed by a company and website—Ants2Whale and ants2whale[.
Some information has been redacted from this report to preserve victim anonymity.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: MAR-10322463-7.v1.stix.
This OSX program from the Ants2Whale site is an Apple DMG installer.
The OSX program does not have a digital signature and will warn the user of that before installation.
Similar to all previous OSX AppleJeus variants, there is a postinstall script and a plist file which creates a LaunchDaemon to automatically run the Ants2WhaleHelper program.
The website appears to show a legitimate cryptocurrency company and application, though it does contain multiple spelling and grammar mistakes indicating the creator may not have English as a first language.
The website states that in order to download, a user must contact the administrator as their product is “premium package."
The domain ants2whale.com had a legitimately signed Sectigo Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, which was “Domain Control Validated” just as all previous AppleJeus domain certificates.
The certificate was is valid from 09/21/2020 – 09/21/2021.
The domain is registered with NameCheap at the IP address 198.54.114.237 with ASN 22612.
This IP is on the same ASN as the CoinGoTrade (AppleJeus variant 5 and Dorusio IP addresses (AppleJeus variant 6).
Figure 1 - Screenshot the ants2whale.com site.
Figure 2 - Screenshot of how to download Ants2Whale.
This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG installer "Ants2Whale.dmg."
Ants2Whale is likely a copy of an open source cryptocurrency wallet application.
When ran it loads a legitimate looking program which is fully functional and is very similar to the AppleJeus variant 5 "CoinGoTrade" application.
Similar to CoinGoTrade there are references to “CryptoMex” in the Ants2Whale application.
Similarly to the CoinGoTrade application, the strings from Ants2Whale reveal the C2 hxxp[:]//45.147.231.77:3000.
Investigation revealed the IP address 45.147.231.77 was hosted at Combahton GMH.

This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG installer "Ants2Whale.dmg."
Ants2WhaleHelper is similar to variants of AppleJeus.
The Ants2WhaleHelper program contains the custom C++ "Barbeque" class for network communication as seen in the unioncryptoupater program.
The C2 for this program is hxxps[:]//www[.
