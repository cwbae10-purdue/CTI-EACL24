This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified a malware variant used by the North Korean government.
This malware has been identified as ELECTRICFISH.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be tunneled between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address.
The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows either side to initiate a tunneling session.
The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and password.
This feature allows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised systemâ€™s required authentication to reach outside of the network.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:
This file is a malicious Windows 32-bit executable.
The application is a command-line utility and its primary purpose is to tunnel traffic between two IP addresses.
The application accepts command-line arguments allowing it to be configured with a destination IP address and port, a source IP address and port, a proxy IP address and port, and a user name and password, which can be utilized to authenticate with a proxy server.
It will attempt to establish TCP sessions with the source IP address and the destination IP address.
If a connection is made to both the source and destination IPs, this malicious utility will implement a custom protocol, which will allow traffic to rapidly and efficiently be tunneled between two machines.
If necessary, the malware can authenticate with a proxy to be able to reach the destination IP address.
The header of the initial authentication packet, sent to both the source and destination systems, will be static except for two random bytes.
Everything within this 34-byte header is static except for the bytes 0X2B6E, which will change during each connection attempt.
Displayed below (and displayed in Figure 7) is the packet header.--Begin Authentication Packet Sent to Destination System--6161616162626262636363636464646400000000000000002B6E0000040000009210--End Authentication Packet Sent to Destination System--
Figure 1 - Screenshot of the malware authenticating with the proxy server configured at command prompt.
Figure 2 - Screenshot of the malware building the authentication packet that will be sent to the destination system.
It must begin with the static value "aaaa" for it to be accepted by the utility.
Figure 3 - Screenshot of the malware evaluating a received authentication packet.
Figure 4 - Screenshot of the malware system authentication packet to the source/destination system.
Figure 5 - Screenshot of the authentication packet sent to the source/destination system during analysis.
The malware will attempt to tunnel traffic between the source and destination systems specified in the command prompt.
Figure 6 - Screenshot of the malware generating two-bytes of random data which will be included in the authentication packet sent to the source/destination systems.
Figure 7 - Screenshot of the authentication packet sent to "source" system with lab environment.
Malware will attempt to tunnel traffic between the source and destination systems specified at command prompt.
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
