This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as BLINDINGCAN.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a presence on victim networks and to further network exploitation.
A threat group with a nexus to North Korea targeted government contractors early this year to gather intelligence surrounding key military and energy technologies.
The malicious documents employed in this campaign used job postings from leading defense contractors as lures and installed a data gathering implant on a victim's system.
This campaign utilized compromised infrastructure from multiple countries to host its command and control (C2) infrastructure and distribute implants to a victim's system.
CISA and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to CISA or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
The threat actor whose activity is described in this report may have included images of logos and products, such as the examples in this report, as a part of a social engineering strategy.
CISA received four Microsoft Word Open Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents (.docx), two Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs).
The .docx files attempt to connect to external domains for a download.
A 32-bit and a 64-bit DLL was submitted that install a 32-bit and a 64-bit DLL named "iconcache.db" respectively.
The DLL "iconcache.db" unpacks and executes a variant of Hidden Cobra RAT.
It contains built-in functions for remote operations that provide various capabilities on a victim’s system.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10295134-1.v1.stix.

This application is a 32-bit DLL.
Upon execution, it decodes an embedded Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX) packed DLL using a hard-coded XOR key: "0x59".
This application is a 32-bit UPX packed DLL installed by d40ad4cd39350d718e189adf45703eb3a3935a7cf8062c20c663bc14d28f78c9 into the C:\ProgramData\iconcache.db" directory.
During execution, it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher to decrypt and then decompress two embedded DLL binaries "bdfd16dc53f5c63da0b68df71c6e61bad300e59fd5748991a6b6a3650f01f9a1" and "7d507281e2e21476ff1af492ad9f574b14cbf77eb4cda9b67e4256318c7c6bbd" in memory.
These binaries are loaded and executed in memory during runtime.
This application is a malicious 32-bit DLL unpacked and executed by "b70e66d387e42f5f04b69b9eb15306036702ab8a50b16f5403289b5388292db9".
This binary has been identified as a variant of a Hidden Cobra RAT.
This file contains embedded configuration data (2704 bytes).
The data is decrypted using a hard-coded AES decryption key "XEUFC1L3DF3C2ROU" before being decoded using an XOR cipher.
Displayed below is the content of the decoded data:
			--Begin configuration data--
			hxxps[:]//www[.

			c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe
			%temp%
			--End configuration data--
			The malware decrypts its strings using a hard-coded RC4 key: "0D 06 09 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 01 01 05 00 03 82".
--End system information--
			It attempts to retrieve the User-Agent string from the victim's system.
If not available, it uses the following embedded User-Agent string:
			--Begin User-Agent String--
			"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.0.3578.98 Safari/537.36" .
The first part consists of a Base64 encoded nine random generated lower case character RC4 key used for encryption.
The second part of the 'id=' parameter tag will contain three parameters randomly selected from a list of the below strings.
These three randomly selected name tags are colon delimited and stored in the following format:"first name tag:second name tag:third name tag".
This data is encrypted using the nine random character generated RC4 key and Base64 encoded.
This data is encrypted using the same generated RC4 key before Base64 encoded.
The third parameter tag 'bbsNo=' is a randomly selected name from a list of the above string tags which contains a hard-coded string data "T1B7D95256A2001E" in the malware.
This data is encrypted using the RC4 key and then the data is Base64 encoded.
Analysis indicates that when encrypting data from the first three parameters, the encryption starts "0xC00 bytes" into the RC4 key stream.
The fourth parameter tag 'bname=' is a randomly selected name from the list of the above string tags which contains the datagram to be sent.
The datagram is encrypted with a combination of RC4 and differential XOR.
The RC4 key used is "0D 06 09 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 01 01 05 00 03 82".

This file is designed to unmap the DLL "C:\ProgramData\iconcache.db" loaded in the process.
This application is a 64-bit DLL.
Upon execution, it decodes an embedded 64-bit UPX packed DLL using a hard-coded XOR key: "0x59".

This application is a malicious 64-bit DLL unpacked and executed by "d5186efd8502a3a99a66729cb847d3f4be8937a3fec1c2655b6ea81f57a314f5".
This binary has been identified as a 64-bit version of the Hidden Cobra RAT "bdfd16dc53f5c63da0b68df71c6e61bad300e59fd5748991a6b6a3650f01f9a1".
