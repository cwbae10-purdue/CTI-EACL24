This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Remote Access Tool (RAT) malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as COPPERHEDGE.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a presence on victim networks and to further network exploitation.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
The Manuscrypt family of malware is used by advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber actors in the targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges and related entities.
Manuscrypt is a full-featured Remote Access Tool (RAT) capable of running arbitrary commands, performing system reconnaissance, and exfiltrating data.
Six distinct variants have been identified based on network and code features.
The variants are categorized based on common code and a common class structure.
A symbol remains in some of the implants identifying a class name of "WinHTTP_Protocol" and later "WebPacket".
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10288834-1.v1.stix.
This file is a 32-bit Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and has been identified as Variant A.
Variant A uses RC4 encryption to obfuscate import loading with an RC4 key of "0x78292E4C5DA3B5D067F081B736E5D593".
A hard-coded string of "*dJU!
*JE&!M@UNQ@" is embedded in the malware beacons.
This variant also obfuscates Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) header strings using a custom character manipulation where the certain ranges of characters are modified by either adding or subtracting a constant value 9.
Figure 1 - Variant A contains the commands displayed in the table.

This file is a 64-bit DLL and has been identified as Variant A.
Refer to 12C786C490366727CF7279FC141921D8 for analysis.
This file is a 32-bit DLL and has been identified as Variant B.
Variant B generates an HTTP POST request similar to Variant A.
However, in Variant B datagrams are RC4 encrypted.
The implant maintains separate RC4 key streams for each side of the conversation.
The RC4 key used is "0x271A16AB6D7A900EF3FA677DCE8AB268".
The RC4 key streams will reset after the implant receives a "SystemInfo" command.
Variant B performs the same RC4 key as variant A for Application Programming Interface (API) obfuscation.
Figure 2 - Variant B contains the commands displayed in the table.

This file is a 32-bit DLL and has been identified as Variant C. Variant C can be distinguished from previous versions through the absence of the beacon string "*dJU!
*JE&!M@UNQ@" and the use of a generated cookie to pass certain information instead of multi-part HTTP POST requests.
The cookie is designed to appear like a standard Google Analytics cookie.
Like in Variant B, the RC4 key stream will reset after the SystemInfo command.
Variant C performs API loading at runtime but does not obfuscate the strings.
Figure 3 - Variant C contains the commands displayed in the table.

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable and has been identified as Variant D. Variant D generates an HTTP POST request very similar to that of Variant A.
The only difference is the beacon string, this variant uses "t34kjfdla45l".
Datagrams are encrypted with a combination of RC4 and differential XOR.
The RC4 key used is "0x0D06092A864886F70D01010105000382".
Figure 4 - Variant D contains the commands displayed in the table.
The first part consists of nine randomly generated lower case characters to be used as the RC4 key for the first three parameters.
The second part of the 'id' parameter is a colon delimited list of the other three parameter names encrypted with RC4.
Those three parameters are randomly selected from a list of 51 strings.
The second parameter data is the session id.
The third parameter data is a fixed string in the implant: "T1B7D95256A2001E".
When encrypting data from the first three parameters, the encryption starts "0xC00 bytes" into the RC4 key stream.
The last parameter will contain the datagram to be sent.
The datagram is encrypted in the same manner as Variant B Version 1.0 using a combination of RC4 and differential XOR.
The only difference is the additional layer of Base64 encoding.

Figure 6 - Variant F contains the commands displayed in the table.
