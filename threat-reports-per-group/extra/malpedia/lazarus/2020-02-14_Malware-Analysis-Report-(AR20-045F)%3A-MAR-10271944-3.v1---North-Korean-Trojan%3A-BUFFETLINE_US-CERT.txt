This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as BUFFETLINE.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report looks at a full-featured beaconing implant.
This sample uses PolarSSL for session authentication, but then utilizes a FakeTLS scheme for network encoding using a modified RC4 algorithm.
It has the capability to download, upload, delete, and execute files; enable Windows CLI access; create and terminate processes; and perform target system enumeration.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10271944-3.v1.stix.
The sample performs dynamic DLL importing and API lookups using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress on obfuscated strings in an attempt to hide it’s usage of network functions.
The sample obfuscates strings used for API lookups as well as the strings used during the network handshake using a modified RC4 algorithm.
A Python 3 script to decrypt the obfuscated strings is given below.
Note: The hardcoded command and control (C2) IP’s are not obfuscated, but appear in plaintext within the executable.
It uses the PolarSSL server_name extension with the Server Name set to "!Q@W#E$R%T^Y&U*I(O)P".
The PolarSSL certificate and private key are provided below.
Instead, it uses a FakeTLS scheme, where a 'fake' TLS packet header is prepended to the packet data which is encrypted with custom xor encryption scheme.
The FakeTLS packet format and a Python 3 script to decrypt network traffic is given below.
--Begin FakeTLS Packet Structure--
			17 03 02 <2 Byte data length> <4 Byte Key> <data>
			--End Fake TLS Packet Structure--
			Note: Each "Key" is generated by the sender rand( ).
After this exchange, the implant sends it’s Victim Information (Figure 2), and then waits for tasking from the C2.

// The following Snort rule can be used to detect the FakeTLS handshake packets by targeting to a
			// logical inconsistency in the appdata packet sizes due to the inclusion of the 4 Byte decode key
			// before the data, but not being included in the data length.

CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
