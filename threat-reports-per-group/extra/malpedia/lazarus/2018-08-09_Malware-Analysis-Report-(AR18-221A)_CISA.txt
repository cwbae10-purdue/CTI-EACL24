This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as KEYMARBLE.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
