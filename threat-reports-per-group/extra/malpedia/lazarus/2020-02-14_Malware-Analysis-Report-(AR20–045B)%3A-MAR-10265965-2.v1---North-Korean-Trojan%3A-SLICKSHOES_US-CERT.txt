This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as SLICKSHOES.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This sample is a Themida-packed dropper that decodes and drops a file "C:\Windows\Web\taskenc.exe" which is a Themida-packed beaconing implant.
The beaconing implant does not execute the dropped file nor does it schedule any tasks to run the malware.
The dropped beaconing implant uses an indigenous network encoding algorithm and is capable of many features including conducting system surveys, file upload/download, process and command execution, and screen captures.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10265965-2.v1.stix.
This sample is a Themida-packed dropper that decodes and drops an embedded file (MD5: B57DB76CC1C0175C4F18EA059D9E2AB2 / SHA256: 7250ccf4fad4d83d087a03d0dd67d1c00bf6cb8e7fa718140507a9d5ffa50b54) to C:\Windows\Web\taskenc.exe.
This dropper does not execute the dropped file or create any auto-run keys or scheduled tasks to execute it.
The dropped file (taskenc.exe) is a Themida-packed beaconing implant with RAT functionality.
The implant beacons to a hardcoded IP (188.165.37.168) over the hardcoded TCP port 80 every 60 seconds.
The initial beacon contains the string “ApolloZeus” as well as victim information, including OS version, user name, and IP address.
All traffic, including the beacon, is encoded with an indigenous encoding algorithm.
Due to the way the implant decodes the hardcoded string “ApolloZeus” in-place in memory, the first beacon contains the string in plaintext, the second beacon will contain the string encoded, and so on.
This is probably unintended and an oversight by the developers.

CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
