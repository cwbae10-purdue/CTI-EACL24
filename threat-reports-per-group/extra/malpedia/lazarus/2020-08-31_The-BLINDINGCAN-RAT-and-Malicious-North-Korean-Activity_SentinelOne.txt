There has been a great deal of coverage lately around malicious activities attributed to North Korea (and/or adjacent entities).
Most recently, this has culminated in the release of MAR (Malware Analysis Report) AR20-232A, which covers activities associated with the BLINDINGCAN RAT.
This tool is the latest in a very long line of tools which allow attackers to maintain access to target environments as well as establish ongoing control of infected hosts.
In this post, we give an overview of this campaign in context of other related campaigns, describing its infection vector, execution and high-level behavior.
As we know, email phishing attacks are still the dominant method of delivering malware when it comes to these types of attacks.
The BLINDINGCAN campaigns are no different, but their phishing lure comes with an interesting twist: malicious documents utilized in the campaign masquerade as job offers and postings from high-value defense contractors such as Boeing.
This isn’t the first time such a lure has been used.
Sophisticated attackers have sought to mimic entities in the defense, military, and government space in the past.
This is especially true, historically, with campaigns tied to North Korea.
Even early on in 2020, Operation North Star followed a very similar modus operandi, and by some accounts these campaigns may be related.
CISA maintains a running repository of North Korean / Hidden Cobra related advisories and details.
Their alerts cover campaigns from 2017 to present, including (but not limited to):
In short, the DPRK has a long history of these types of campaigns and it does not appear to be letting up in frequency or aggressiveness.
Moreover, North Korea is no stranger to playing the ‘long-game’.
Reflecting back on earlier attacks from the region (e.g., Operation Troy, Ten Days of Rain, Dark Seoul, and the Sony attack) we see similar tactics and aggressiveness.
The BLINDINGCAN campaign has been specifically focused on defense and aerospace targets, primarily based in Europe and the United States.
According to AR20-232a: “The FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers” along with “compromised infrastructure from multiple countries to host its command and control (C2) infrastructure”.
The objective of these attacks is to gain intelligence and to understand the key technologies that fall under the umbrella of the targeted entity, as well as those adjacent to them (contactors, partners, etc.)
The malicious documents themselves, upon launch, attempt to exploit CVE-2017-0199.
This particular flaw allows for remote code execution via maliciously crafted documents.
More specifically, CVE-2017-0199 is a result of the flawed processing of RTF files and elements by way of a potent combination of object links and HTA payloads.
This vulnerability is a common vector of attack for malicious actors, and despite the flaw being patched long ago, attackers bet on the fact (often successfully) that at least some of their targets will still be exposed to the flaw, allowing them to achieve their foothold.
You can see this behavior immediately upon launching one of the malicious documents.
The samples we analyzed reach out to a remote server (C2) for additional components.
Once established, a keylogging and clipboard monitoring component is dropped, and additional information is extracted from the targeted hosts.
WMI commands are utilized to gleen basic system details:
The RAT component (e.g., 58027c80c6502327863ddca28c31d352e5707f5903340b9e6ccc0997fcb9631d) can be found in both 32 and 64 bit varieties.
The executable payloads employ multiple levels of obfuscation.
Configuration data for the RAT is embedded in the payloads and is both encrypted and encoded.
Embedded configuration artifacts are AES-encrypted with a hard-coded key.
Upon decrypting, the resulting data is then decoded via XOR.
Strings in the malware are RC4 encrypted.
The RAT module will initially pull basic system data.
The aforementioned WMI command is part of this system reconnaissance process.
In this stage, the malware will pull local network data, system name, OS version details, processor/platform details and MAC address details, and then push this data to the C2.
The core RAT feature set boils down to the following:
While the malware and implants discussed here are specific to operations attributed to North Korea, the delivery and weaponization states are common to most other APT groups and non-nation-state backed campaigns.
Prevention, as always, is key.
The SentinelOne Singularity Platform is fully capable of detecting and preventing malicious activity associated with HIDDEN COBRA and BLINDINGCAN.
