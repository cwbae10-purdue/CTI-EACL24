This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD).
Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government.
This malware variant has been identified as HOTCROISSANT.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report looks at a full-featured beaconing implant.
This sample performs a custom XOR network encoding and is capable of many features including conducting system surveys, file upload/download, process and command execution, and performing screen captures.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10271944-1.v1.stix.
The sample performs dynamic DLL importing and API lookups using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress on obfuscated strings in an attempt to hide it’s usage of network functions.
However, only a small number of API calls are obfuscated this way, and their selection is not consistent through the sample.
The sample obfuscates strings used for API lookups as well as the strings used during the network handshake using a simple Byte xor with 0x0f.
The sample attempts to connect to a hardcoded C2 IP and then immediately sends it’s Victim Info.
It then listens for commands from the C2 and returns the results.
Network communications are first zipped and then encoded with a custom xor algorithm.
The session structure (Figure 1), packet format (Figure 2), victim information (Figure 3), a Python 3 script to decrypt network traffic, and implant functionality (Figure 4) are given below.

Figure 3 - Implant Functionality.
The following commands from the table above appear to be broken: ProcessKill - Programmer coding error that results in an access violation.
It attempts to decode an obfuscated string (Kernel32.dll) in-place instead of doing a string copy first like they do everywhere else.
WindowClose - The handle used to loop through all windows is never initialized.

8EE7DA59F68C691C9ECA1AC70FF03155ED07808C7A66DEE49886B51A59E00085 connects to this C2 IP address.
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
