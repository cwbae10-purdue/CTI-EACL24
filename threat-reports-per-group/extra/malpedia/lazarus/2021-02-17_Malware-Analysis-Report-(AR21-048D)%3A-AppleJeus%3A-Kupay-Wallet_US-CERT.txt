This MAR highlights this cyber threat posed by North Korea and provides detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.
For more information on other versions of AppleJeus and recommended steps to mitigate this threat, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-048A: AppleJeus: Analysis of Lazarus Group Cryptocurrency Malware at https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA21-048A.
There have been multiple versions of AppleJeus malware discovered since its initial discovery in August 2018.
In most versions, the malware appears to be from a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency trading company and website, whereby an unsuspecting individual downloads a third-party application from a website that appears legitimate.
The U.S. Government has identified AppleJeus malware version—Kupay Wallet—and associated IOCs used by the North Korean government in AppleJeus operations.
Kupay Wallet, discovered in March 2020, is a legitimate-looking cryptocurrency trading software that is marketed and distributed by a company and website—Kupay Service and kupaywallet[.
Some information has been redacted from this report to preserve victim anonymity.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: MAR-10322463-4.v1.stix.
This Windows program from the Kupay Service site is a Windows MSI Installer with the file name Kupay[GUID].msi.
The installer was hosted at hxxps[:]kupaywallet.com/product/[GUID].
The [GUID] is a unique file that is crated for a specific victim and is being withheld to preserve the identity of the intended recipient.
The installer looks legitimate and will install the "Kupay.exe" (1b60a6d35c872102f535ae6a3d7669fb7d55c43dc7e73354423fdcca01a955d6) file in the “C:\Program Files (x86)\Kupay” folder.
It also installs "KupayUpgrade.exe" (fc1aafd2ed190fa523e60c3d22b6f7ca049d97fc41c9a2fe987576d6b5e81d6d) in the “C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\KupaySupport” folder.
Immediately after installation, the installer launches the "KupayUpgrade.exe" binary.

Whois for kupaywallet.com had the following information:
			Registrar: NAMECHEAP INC
			Creation Date: 2020-02-21
			Registrar Registration Expiration Date: 2021-02-21
The domain kupaywallet.com had a legitimately signed Sectigo Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, which was “Domain Control Validated” just as all previous AppleJeus domain certificates.
Investigation revealed the point of contact listed for verification was admin[@]kupaywallet.com.
No other contact information was available as the administrative or technical contact for the kupaywallet.com domain.
The domain is registered with NameCheap at the IP address 104.200.67.96 with ASN 8100.
In addition to the site kupaywallet.com, a Twitter account @kupayservice is associated with the company.
This account tweets out general cryptocurrency articles and information and replies to various related tweets.
The first tweet was on May 23, 2019, while the last was on July 11, 2019.
Twitter lists the joined date for @kupayservice to be October 2018.

This file is a 64-bit Windows executable contained within the Windows MSI Installer "Kupay.msi."
When executed, "Kupay.exe" loads a legitimate looking cryptocurrency wallet application with no signs of malicious activity.
This application appears to be a modification of the open source cryptocurrency wallet Copay, which is distributed by Atlanta based company BitPay.
According to their website bitpay.com, “BitPay builds powerful, enterprise-grade tools for crypto acceptance and spending."
In addition to application appearance being similar, a DNS request for "bitpay.com" is always sent out immediately after a DNS request for "kupaywallet.com" and the company listed in the version information for Kupay is Bitpay.
Lastly, the GitHub “Commit Hash” listed in the Dorusio application “638b2b1” is to a branch of Copay found at hxxps[:]//github.com/flean/copay-1 (Figure 5).

This file is a 64-bit Windows executable contained within the Windows MSI Installer "Kupay.msi."
When executed, "KupayUpgrade.exe" first installs itself as a service, which will automatically start when any user logs on.
The service is installed with a description stating “Automatic Kupay Upgrade."
On startup, "KupayUpgrade.exe" allocates memory in order to later write a file.
After allocating the memory and storing the hard-coded string “Latest” in a variable, the program attempts to open a network connection.
The connection is named “Kupay Wallet 9.0.1 (Check Update Windows)”, likely to avoid suspicion from a user.
Similarly to previous AppleJeus variants, "KupayUpgrade.exe "collects some basic information from the system as well as a timestamp, and places them in hard coded format strings.
Specifically, the timestamp is placed into a format string “ver=%d&timestamp=%lu” where ver is set as the 90001, possibly referring to the Kupay Wallet version previously mentioned (Figure 7).
This basic information and hard-coded strings are sent via a POST to the C2 kupaywallet.com/kupay_update.php.
If the POST is successful (i.e.
returns an HTTP response status code of 200) but fails any of multiple different checks, "KupayUpgrade.exe" will sleep for two minutes and then regenerate the timestamp and contact the C2 again.
After receiving the payload from the C2, the program writes the payload to memory and executes the payload.
The payload for the Windows malware could not be downloaded, as the C2 server "kupaywallet.com/kupay_update.php" was no longer accessible.
In addition, the sample was not identified in open source reporting for this sample.

In March 2020, a download link for the OSX version of Kupay Wallet was found to be hosted at hxxps[:]//kupaywallet.com/[GUID].
The OSX program from the Kupay Wallet download link is an Apple DMG installer.
The [GUID] is a unique file that is crafted for a specific victim and is being withheld to preserve the identity of the intended recipient.
The OSX program uses a DMG installer with the file name Kupay[GUID].dmg.
The OSX program does not have digital signature, and will warn of that before installation.
Just as JMTTrader, CelasTradePro, and UnionCrypto, the Kupay installer appears to be legitimate, and installs both “Kupay” in the “/Applications/Kupay.app/Contents/MacOS/” folder and a program named kupay_upgrade also in the “/Applications/Kupay.app/Contents/MacOS/” folder.
The installer contains a postinstall script (Figure 8).
The postinstall script is identical in functionality to the postinstall scripts from previous AppleJeus variants, though accomplishes the same functions in a different way than previously done.
The postinstall script creates a “KupayDaemon” folder in the OSX “/Library/Application Support” folder, and moves kupay_upgrade to it.
The “Application Support” folder contains both system and third-party support files which are necessary for program operation.
Typically, the subfolders have names matching those of the actual applications.
At installation, Kupay placed the plist file (com.kupay.pkg.wallet.plist) in “/Library/LaunchDaemons/”.
While previous versions of AppleJeus simply moved the plist file to the LaunchDaemons folder and waited for a restart for it to be loaded, the Kupay postinstall runs the command “launchctl load” to load the plist without a restart.
The postinstall then launches the kupay_upgrade program in the background.
Figure 8 - Screenshot of the postinstall script.
Figure 9 - Screenshot of "com.kupay.pkg.wallet.plist."
This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG "Kupay.dmg."
Kupay is likely a copy of an open source cryptocurrency wallet application.
When ran it loads a legitimate looking wallet program, which is fully functional, and is identical to the Windows Kupay.exe program.
Although this executable is not inherently malicious, organizations who identify the hash and a "kupay[GUID].dmg" present on a system should assume they are compromised if it is present with other files or activity described in this report.
This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG "Kupay.dmg."
When executed, "kupay_upgrade" immediately sleeps for five seconds and then tests to see if the hard-coded value stored in “isReady” is a 0 or a 1.
If it is a 0, the program sleeps again, and if it is a 1, the function “CheckUpdate” is called.
This function contains most of the logic functionality of the malware.
"CheckUpdate" sends a POST to the C2 hxxps[:]//kupaywallet.com/kupay_update.php with a connection named “Kupay Wallet 9.0.1 (Check Update Osx)."
Just as the Windows malware, the timestamp is placed into a format string “ver=%d&timestamp=%ld” where ver is set as the 90001, possibly referring to the AppleJeus version 4 Kupay Wallet (Figure 11).
If the C2 server returns a file, it is decoded and written to “/private/tmp/kupay_update”, with permissions by the command chmod 700 (only the user can read, write, and execute).
The stage2 (/private/tmp/kupay_update) is then launched, and the malware kupay_upgrade returns to sleeping and checking in with the C2 server.
Figure 10 - Screenshot of the C2 loaded into variable.
Figure 11 - Screenshot of the format string.
This file is the stage 2 payload for the OSX KupayWallet.
The stage 2 payload for the OSX KupayWallet was decoded and analyzed, and file properties are related to the decoded file.
The stage 2 kupay_update has a variety of functionalities.
Most importantly, kupay_update checks in with the C2 levelframeblog.com/felix.php.
After connecting to the C2, kupay_update can send or receive a payload, read and write files, execute commands via the terminal, etc.
If a payload is received or is going to be sent, kupay_update will base64 encode/decode and XOR encode/decode the data before sending or after receiving.
The functions which base64 encode and decode are named b64_encode and b64_decode.
The functions which XOR encodes and decodes is XEncoding, and it uses a 32-byte XOR key which is hardcoded into kupay_update.
The key is “wLqfM]%wTx`~tUTbw>R^0x18#yG5R(30x7FC:;” where all values are in ASCII except for 0x18 and 0x7F as those are non-readable characters in ASCII.
This key is also used in the DecryptPayload and CryptPayload functions.
These two functions implement the XOR encode or decode without calling XEncoding, and also call the b64_decode and b64_encode functions.
Kupay_update checks in with the C2 frequently, in order to execute or preform whatever commands and requests the server sends.
There are multiple “sleep” calls throughout the function to dictate when the contact with the C2 is made.
