This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework.
See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat actor techniques.
This Alert has been updated to include information on vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors (see Table 4).
In addition to the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this Alert, CISA recommends organizations take the following actions.
China has a history of using national military and economic resources to leverage offensive cyber tactics in pursuing its national interests.
The “Made in China 2025” 10-year plan outlines China’s top-level policy priorities.
[3] China has exercised its increasingly sophisticated capabilities to illegitimately obtain U.S. intellectual property (IP), suppress both social and political perspectives deemed dangerous to China, and harm regional and international opponents.
China continues to engage in espionage-related activities that include theft of sensitive information such as innovation capital, IP, and personally identifiable information (PII).
China has demonstrated a willingness to push the boundaries of their activities to secure information critical to advancing their economic prowess and competitive advantage.
Additionally, numerous Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments over several years provide evidence to suggest Chinese threat actors continuously seek to illegally obtain and exfiltrate U.S. IP.
Their targets also include western companies with operations inside China.
Public reporting that associates Chinese actors with a range of high-profile attacks and offensive cyber activity includes:
The section below provides common, publicly known, TTPs employed by Chinese threat actors, which map to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
Where possible, the tables include actions for detection and mitigation.
This section is not exhaustive and does not detail all TTPs or detection and mitigation actions.
Chinese threat actors commonly use the techniques listed in table 1 to achieve reconnaissance (Technical Information Gathering [TA0015]), staging (Stage Capabilities [TA0026]), and testing (Test Capabilities [TA0025]) before executing an attack.
PRE-ATT&CK techniques can be difficult to detect and mitigate, however, defenders should be aware of the use of these techniques.
Table 1: Chinese threat actor PRE-ATT&CK techniques
Chinese threat actors often employ publicly known TTPs against enterprise networks.
To orchestrate attacks, they use commonly implemented security testing tools and frameworks, such as:
Table 2 lists common, publicly known, TTPs used by Chinese threat actors against enterprise networks and provides options for detection and mitigation based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
Table 2: Common Chinese threat actor techniques, detection, and mitigation
The TTPs listed above have been repeatedly used across the spectrum of Chinese threat actors.
The mitigations referenced in this alert can help reduce vulnerability to these TTPs; however, defenders should also maintain heightened awareness of threats actors that are more innovative in their approach, making it difficult to detect and respond to compromise.
The following list provides actionable technical recommendations for IT security professionals to reduce their organization’s overall vulnerability.
These recommendations are not exhaustive; rather they focus on the actions that will greatly reduce stakeholders’ attack surface.
Table 3: Patch information for vulnerabilities routinely exploited by Chinese APT actors
Microsoft Office 2003 SP3, 2007 SP2 and SP3, and 2010 Gold and SP1; Office 2003 Web Components SP3; SQL Server 2000 SP4, 2005 SP4, and 2008 SP2, SP3, and R2; BizTalk Server 2002 SP1; Commerce Server 2002 SP4, 2007 SP2, and 2009 Gold and R2; Visual FoxPro 8.0 SP1 and 9.0 SP2; and Visual Basic 6.0
