Recent BitDefender wrote up a very detailed report on a loader that shares similarities with WastedLocker being delivered via RIG exploit kit[1].
At the time I was researching Dridex chains and since WastedLocker has code similarities with Dridex[2] and being leveraged by EvilCorp[2,3,4,5,6] I took a quick look at the hashes from the report.
Of the hashes from the report only 1 seems publicly available, 6ee2138d5467da398e02afe2baea9fbe.
In the BitDefender report they reference an overlap with WastedLocker in what they label as ‘layer1’, this is actually the crypter layer meaning if the crypter is private to one group then the overlap will show up in known malware associated with this group.
After beginning to decode some of the strings I started to notice that itlooks more and more like a Dridex Loader.
Small snippet of decoded strings below:
So I decided to check if the CAPE sandbox yara rule perhaps matches this unpacked sample as a Dridex Loader[7], I used the rule from the CAPE decoder and it hit on the unpacked sample.
Along with the decoder being about to decode out the Dridex Loader config I believe it is safe to say this is the Dridex Loader, leaving one to guess whether the other two samples are also Dridex Loaders or not?
