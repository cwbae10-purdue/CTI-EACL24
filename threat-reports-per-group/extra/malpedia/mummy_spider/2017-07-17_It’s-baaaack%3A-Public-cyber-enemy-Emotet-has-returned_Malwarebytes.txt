It was never a question of “if” but “when”.
After five months of absence, the dreaded Emotet has returned.
Following several false alarms over the last few weeks, a spam campaign was first spotted on July 13 showing signs of a likely comeback.
The Emotet botnets started pushing malspam actively on Friday, July 17, using the same techniques as employed in its last wave of activity.
Malicious emails contain either a URL or an attachment that, once clicked on or opened, launches the Emotet payload.
One familiar technique is for the document to be sent as a reply within existing email threads.
The document contains a heavily obfuscated macro:
Once the macro is enabled, WMI launches PowerShell to retrieve the Emotet binary from one of the remote compromised websites.
It will iterate through a list until it identifies one that is responding.
Once the payload is executed, it will send a confirmation back to one of Emotet’s command and control servers.
Emotet was by far the most visible and active threat on our radars in 2018 and 2019—right up until the start of 2020, when it went into an extended break.
One of the reasons why it was (and is) so successful is because of its constant evolution in attack techniques and threat partnerships.
For example, according to Bleeping Computer, Emotet now uses stolen email attachments to add credibility to the spam it generates to infect targeted systems.
This is in addition to the aforementioned technique of hijacking email threads—a social engineering strategy employed to increase the likelihood of infection.
Emotet is used by cybercriminals as the initial entry point for infecting an organization, followed by a dwell time that can last days or weeks.
In the meantime, it often drops secondary payloads to further penetrate its target’s defenses.
In its most recent incarnation, Emotet has been observed dropping secondary payloads, such as TrickBot and QakBot to spread laterally and steal credentials.
In fact, the real damage caused by an Emotet compromise happens when it forms alliances with other malware gangs—particularly with those threat actors interested in dropping ransomware, such as Ryuk, which was a constant partner of Emotet’s in 2019.
So far, a prevalent ransomware family has not yet been identified in Emotet’s latest campaign.
Users looking to protect against Emotet should first keep a wary eye out for phishing and/or spam emails—especially any emails with attachments.
Even emails that appear to be from known contacts should be treated with suspicion.
However, if unlucky users happen to click on a malicious URL or open an infected document, a good security program—especially one with anti-exploit technology—will block the malware from launching and keep computers free from infection.
For more information on how to protect against or remediate an Emotet infection, take a look at our emergency kit, which includes a summary of the threat and a checklist of tips.
Malwarebytes Premium and business users are already protected against Emotet, thanks to our signature-less anti-exploit technology.
We also detect the Emotet binary as a standalone file:
 June 30, 2021 - DoubleVPN, a VPN service that promised to double- and triple-encrypt web activity, was seized after allegedly being favored for cybercrime.
 June 16, 2021 - Clop ransomware activity was stopped by Ukrainian cops on Wednesday who shut down the ransomware gang's infrastructure and made arrests.
 June 8, 2021 - The US Department of Justice announced Monday that it recovered much of the ransomware payment that Colonial Pipeline paid to Darkside.
 March 2, 2021 - French researchers have found a Ryuk ransomware variant that can spread laterally through an infected network.
 February 16, 2021 - Through the chaos and devastation of 2020, one form of business seems to have thrived—the creation and operation of malicious software.
