Cofense • Threat Intelligence | March 15, 2019
We are currently noticing a change in the way that the Emotet botnet, specifically the epoch 1 variant, is communicating with the C2.
In past versions, the client would typically perform a GET request with data contained in the cookie value.
As of approximately 11pm UTC on March 14, this changed.
The clients have begun to perform HTTP POSTs to what appear to be their C2s.
The URI’s contacted contain variable words in the paths.
We are seeing form data passed with a name variable and data.
This change will break researchers as well as certain detection technologies while they scurry to retool.
We will continue to track this change and analyze what this means.
