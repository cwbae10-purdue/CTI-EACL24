After a fairly long hiatus that lasted nearly four months, Emotet is back with an active spam distribution campaign.
For a few weeks, there were signs that the botnet was setting its gears in motion again, as we observed command and control (C2) server activity.
But this morning, the Trojan started pumping out spam, a clear indication it’s ready to jump back into action.
The malicious emails started in the wee hours of Monday morning, with templates spotted in German, Polish, and Italian.
Our Threat Intelligence team started seeing phishing emails sent in English as well with the subject line “Payment Remittance Advice.”
Note the personalization in the email subject lines.
Borrowing a tactic from North Korean nation-state actors, Emotet’s creators are bringing back highly sophisticated spear phishing functionality introduced in April 2019, which includes hijacking old email threads and referencing to the user by name.
Victims are lured to open the attached document and enable the macro to kick-start the infection process.
The PowerShell command triggered by the macro attempts to download Emotet from compromised sites, often running on the WordPress content management system (CMS).
There are alternate delivery techniques as well.
For example, some instances of the malicious document rely on a downloader script instead.
Once the download is successful and Emotet is installed on the endpoint, it begins propagating by spreading laterally to other endpoints in the network and beyond.
It also steals credentials from installed applications and spams the user’s contact list.
Perhaps the biggest threat, though, is that Emotet serves as a delivery vector for more dangerous payloads, such as TrickBot and other ransomware families.
Emotet is most notorious for collateral damage inflicted as part of a blended attack.
Alternatively, compromised machines can lay in a dormant state until operators decide to hand off the job to other criminal groups that will demand large sums of money—up to US$5 million—from their victims.
In the past, we’ve seen the infamous Ryuk ransomware deployed in this way.
While Emotet is typically focused on infecting organizations, individual consumers may also be at risk.
Malwarebytes business customers and Malwarebytes for Windows Premium home users are already guarded against this campaign, thanks to our signature-less anti-exploit technology.
As always, we recommend users be cautious when opening emails with attachments, even if they appear to come from acquaintances.
Users who are not Malwarebytes customers or who use the free scanner will want to take additional steps to protect against Emotet or clean up the infection, if they’ve already been hit.
Businesses and organizations that may currently be battling an Emotet infection can contact Malwarebytes for immediate help.
Or, for more background information on how Emotet works and a list of tips for remediation and tips, view our Emotet emergency kit.
As this campaign is not even a day old, we don’t yet know the impact on organizations and other users.
We will continue to update this post as we learn more throughout the day.
In the meantime, warn your coworkers, friends, and family to be wary of emails disguised as invoices or any other “phishy” instances.
