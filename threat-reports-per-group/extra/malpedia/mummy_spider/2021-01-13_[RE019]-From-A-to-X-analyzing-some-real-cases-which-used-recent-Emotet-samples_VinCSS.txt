the most dangerous Trojan today.
Through mass email spam campaigns, it targets mostly
companies and organizations to steal sensitive information from victims.

records show that Emotet is often
used as a downloader for other malware, and is an especially popular delivery
mechanism for banking Trojans, such as Qakbot
and TrickBot, and also lead to
ransomware attacks using Ryuk.
ANY.RUNâ€™s annualreport pointed out that the most active malware in 2020 is Emotet.
In
this article, we analyze
in detail full attack flow in some real cases of recent Emotet samples which were discovered and handled by us while providing cyber security

The
main distribution method of Emotet malware is malicious email campaigns, using
infected attachments, as well as embedded URLs.
These emails may appear to come
from trusted sources (cause the victim's
email account was taken over).

downloading the Trojan onto their machine.
