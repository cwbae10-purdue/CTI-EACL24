Emotet has become one of the world’s most advanced botnets.
Like many malware campaigns, Emotet’s primary mode of delivery is phishing emails that download malicious Microsoft Office documents.
Furthermore, these documents are often hosted in popular cloud apps like Office 365 and Amazon S3 to increase the chances of a successful lure.
At Netskope, we apply a hybrid approach to malicious Office document detection that leverages a combination of heuristics and supervised machine learning to identify malicious code embedded in documents.
In August – September of 2020, we identified Emotet samples that use advanced techniques like (1) constructing a PowerShell script at runtime, (2) constructing WMI namespaces at runtime, and (3) VBA logic obfuscation to evade static and signature-based detections.
On December 9, 2020, Netskope’s Advanced Threat platform detected downloads of multiple novel Emotet samples.
These were distributed as Office documents and included additional techniques being used to evade signature-based threat detection.
These techniques consisted of an Embedded XSL script and a Squiblytwo Attack.
This blog post describes these attack techniques and lists the IOCs associated with the samples.
In this section, we explain how two new  Emotet samples we discovered in December 2020 (IOCs provided at the end of this document) use new attack techniques to further evade detection.
We will use the code extracted from the sample b9c0ade410b564f79bd95febaac9f3f4 throughout this post.
The techniques used in these samples include:
Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files.
The new Emotet samples embedded malicious XSL scripts inside the VBA text control property.
VBA control properties are not usually scanned by AVs as this particular VBA stream (“O” stream) does not contain any VBA code.
However, these samples store the scripts in control properties before downloading and executing them, as we discuss in the next section.
The following screenshot shows the VBA project of one sample.
The XSL string can be seen inside the control brraQWKmlhxwEUuD (Textbox) text property.
In the following screenshots, the VBA code extracts the XSL string and saves it to a local file.
The XSL script contains JScript code which uses the MSXML.HTTP COM object to connect to a live C&C server as well as the ADODB.STREAM COM object to download a malicious dll payload to local disk.
Then, rundll32.exe’s DllRegisterServer() function is invoked on the downloaded dll, which is primarily a banking trojan that steals sensitive information and carries out further infection.
Similar to previously seen non-XSL samples, recognizable keywords like ADODB.STREAM, SHELL and MSXML2.XMLHTTP.60 are reversed to avoid static detection.
These relevant sections of the XSL script can be seen highlighted in red below.
The XSL script is executed using the WMI Command Line Utility (wmic.exe).
MITRE refers to this technique of executing XSL as a squiblytwo attack.
In addition to this approach, the following are done in order to avoid static detection:
The following VBA macro code references an instance of WMI using GetObject() API by passing a moniker string.
The following figure shows the function implementation that constructs the moniker string.
The malicious process is created using the Create() method of WMI’s Win32_Process class, as shown below.
This creation method leaves a minimal identifiable footprint since WMI is now not reported to be a child process of WINWORD.exe but a child of WMIPrvSe.exe (DCOM process).
The first argument to Create is “wmIC” which is constructed at runtime as shown below.
WMI is passed the following arguments to execute the XSL script.
The runtime construction of command line arguments to WMI is shown below.
However, these arguments are not passed during the creation of WMI but instead sent through Windows API PostMessageA() call.
The VBA macro searches the wmic console via FindWindowExA() using “consolewindowclass” as an argument before sending the parameters.
After this, the arguments are sent to the wmic console using PostMessageA() method call.
The Windows API declaration for PostMessageA and FindWindowExA can be seen below.
In the following image, we can see the invocation of PostMessageA() with the arguments to execute the XSL script.
Netskope Advanced Threat Protection provides proactive coverage against zero-day samples of Emotet and other malicious Office documents using both our ML and heuristic-based static analysis engines as well as our cloud sandbox.
The following screenshot shows the detection for b9c0ade410b564f79bd95febaac9f3f4, indicating it was detected by both Netskope AV and the Netskope Advanced Heuristic Engine.
The indicators section shows the reasons it was detected as malicious: the sample auto executes the macro code described in this blog post, writes files to the system, as well as executes system APIs.
In addition to the techniques covered in our previous blog posts, the Emotet samples above use two new advanced techniques to evade signature-based detection.
Netskope Advanced Threat Protection includes a custom Microsoft Office file analyzer and a sandbox to detect campaigns like Emotet that are in active development and are spreading using new Office documents.
We will continue to provide updates on this threat as it evolves.
