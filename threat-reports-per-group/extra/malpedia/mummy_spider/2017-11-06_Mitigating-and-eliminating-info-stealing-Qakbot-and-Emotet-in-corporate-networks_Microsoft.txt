The threat to sensitive financial information is greater than ever.
Data breaches, phishing attacks, and other forms of information theft are all too common in today’s threat landscape.
Point-of-sale systems and ATMs have been targeted by hackers.
Information-stealing trojans pose a risk to data and can lead to significant financial loss.
Qakbot and Emotet are information stealers that have been showing renewed activity in recent months.
These malware families are technically different, but they share many similarities in behavior.
They both have the ultimate goal of stealing online banking credentials that malware operators can then use to steal money from online banking accounts.
They can also steal other sensitive information using techniques like keylogging.
Qakbot and Emotet monthly machine encounters show an upward trend.
This data doesn’t include Qakbot and Emotet variants blocked by automation and cloud rules.
Even though these malware families are typically known to target individual online banking users, more and more enterprises, small and medium businesses, and other organizations have been affected by indiscriminate infections.
Breakdown of Qakbot and Emotet machine encounters
Recent variants of these malware families have spreading capabilities, which can increase the chances of multiple infections in corporate networks.
They can also be spread by other malware during the lateral movement stage of a cyberattack.
Over the years, the cybercriminals behind Qakbot and Emotet have improved the code behind their malware.
They have evolved to evade detection, stay under the radar longer, and increase the chances of spreading to other potential victims.
We mapped some of the common behaviors we’ve seen in Qakbot and Emotet variants and see a lot of similarities.
Qakbot and Emotet attack kill chain.
Note that some Qakbot and Emotet variants might not exhibit all of the behaviors above and might be capable of unique routines.
Because of similarities in behavior, Qakbot and Emotet can be mitigated by similar security measures.
Based on our experience helping organizations get rid of Qakbot and Emotet, the following steps mitigate infection and ultimately remove the said malware from corporate networks:
While the steps above can rid networks of Qakbot and Emotet, preventing infection eliminates opportunities for these threats to steal info.
Windows 10 S is a streamlined platform with Microsoft-verified security.
It blocks malware like Qakbot and Emotet and other malicious programs by working exclusively with apps from the Windows Store, ensuring that only apps that went through the Store onboarding, vetting, and signing process are allowed to run.
Additionally, Windows 10 has a comprehensive defense stack that can help block and detect malware like Qakbot and Emotet.
Use Microsoft Edge to block Qakbot and Emotet infections from the web.
Microsoft Edge opens pages within low privilege app containers and uses reputation-based blocking of malicious downloads.
Its click-to-run feature for Flash can stop malware infections that begin with exploit kits.
With Windows Defender Application Guard, Microsoft Edge has an additional hardware isolation-level capability on top of its exploit mitigation and sandbox features.
Block malicious emails carrying trojan droppers that install Qakbot and Emotet using Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP), which has built-in anti-spam filtering capabilities that help protect Office 365 customers.
Secure mailboxes against email attacks with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, which blocks unsafe attachments, malicious links, and linked-to files leveraging time-of-click protection.
Outlook.com anti-spam filters also provide protection against malicious emails.
Enable Windows Defender Exploit Guard to block malicious documents (such as those that use macro code to install Qakbot and Emotet, or the more recent DDEDownloader that install other malware) and scripts.
The Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) feature in Windows Defender Exploit Guard uses a set of built-in intelligence that can block malicious behaviors observed in malicious documents.
ASR rules can also be turned on to block malicious attachments from being run or launched from Microsoft Outlook or webmail (such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo).
Use Credential Guard to protect domain credentials and help stop malware from spreading using compromised credentials.
Use Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) to manage local account passwords and domain joined computers.
Enable Windows Defender AV to detect Qakbot and Emotet variants, as well as all related malware such as droppers and downloaders.
Windows Defender AV uses precise machine learning models as well as generic and heuristic techniques and enhanced behavior analysis to detect common and complex malware code.
It provides advanced real-time protection against new and unknown files using the Windows Defender AV cloud protection service.
Use Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection to flag Qakbot or Emotet infections and to enable security operations personnel to stop the spread of these threats in the network.
Windows Defender ATP’s enhanced behavioral and machine learning detection libraries flag malicious behavior across the malware infection process, from delivery and installation, to persistence mechanisms, command-and-control communication, and lateral movement.
The new process tree visualization and improvements in machine isolation further help security operations to investigate and respond to attacks.
To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, sign up for a free trial.

These end-to-end security features in Windows 10 help defend against increasingly complex malware attacks.
At Microsoft, we continue to harden Windows 10 against attacks.
With Fall Creators Update, we shipped several new and enhanced security features that make Windows 10 the most secure version of Windows yet.

It is also important for organizations to augment these security technologies with a security-aware workforce.
Educating employees on social engineering attacks and internet safety, and training them to report suspicious emails or websites can go a long way in protecting networks against cyberattacks.
