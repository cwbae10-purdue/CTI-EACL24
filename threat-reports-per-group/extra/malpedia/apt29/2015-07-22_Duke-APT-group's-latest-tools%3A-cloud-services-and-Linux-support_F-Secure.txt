Recent weeks have seen the outing of two new additions to the Duke group's toolset, SeaDuke and CloudDuke.
Of these, SeaDuke is a simple trojan made interesting by the fact that it's written in Python.
And even more curiously, SeaDuke, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the first cross-platform malware we have observed from the Duke group.
While SeaDuke is a single - albeit cross-platform - trojan, CloudDuke appears to be an entire toolset of malware components, or "solutions" as the Duke group apparently calls them.
These components include a unique loader, downloader, and not one but two different trojan components.
CloudDuke also greatly expands on the Duke group's usage of cloud storage services, specifically Microsoft's OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as the exfiltration of stolen data.
While older malware by the Duke group has always been written with a combination of the C and C++ programming languages as well as assembly language, SeaDuke is peculiarly written in Python with multiple layers of obfuscation.
This Python code is usually then compiled into Windows executables using py2exe or pyinstaller.
However, the Python code itself has been designed to work on both Windows and Linux.
We therefore suspect, that the Duke group is also using the same SeaDuke Python code to target Linux victims.
MiniDionis and CloudLook are both components of a larger malware toolset we call CloudDuke.
This toolset consists of malware components that provide varying functionality while partially relying on a shared code framework and always using the same loader.
Based on PDB strings found in the samples, the malware authors refer to the CloudDuke components as "solutions" with names such as "DropperSolution", "BastionSolution" and "OneDriveSolution".
The purpose of the downloader is to download and execute additional malware on the victim's system.
In most observed cases, the downloader will attempt to connect to a compromised website to download an encrypted malicious payload which the downloader will decrypt and execute.
Depending on the way the downloader has been configured, in some cases it may first attempt to log in to Microsoft's cloud storage service OneDrive and retrieve the payload from there.
If no payload is available from OneDrive, the downloader will revert to the previously mentioned method of downloading from compromised websites.We have also observed two distinct trojan components in the CloudDuke toolset.
The first of these, internally called "BastionSolution", is the trojan that Palo Alto Networks described in their research into "MiniDionis".
Interestingly, BastionSolution appears to functionally be an exact copy of SeaDuke with the only real difference being the choice of programming language.
BastionSolution also makes significant use of a code framework that is apparently internally called "Z".
This second component, internally called "OneDriveSolution", is especially interesting because it relies on Microsoft's cloud storage service OneDrive as its command and control channel.
To achieve this, OneDriveSolution will attempt to log into OneDrive with a preconfigured username and password.
If successful, OneDriveSolution will then proceed to copy data from the victim's computer to the OneDrive account.
These spear-phising emails have contained links to compromised websites hosting zip archives that contain CloudDuke-laden executables.
In most cases, executing these executables will have resulted in two additional files being written to the victim's hard disk.
The first of these files has been a decoy, such as an audio file or a PDF file while the second one has been a CloudDuke loader embedding a CloudDuke downloader, the so-called "DropperSolution".
It has apparently been copied by the attackers from here.Interestingly, however, some of the other CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns we have observed this July have born a striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns seen almost exactly a year ago, in the beginning of July 2014.
In both spear-phishing campaigns, the decoy document has been the exact same PDF file, a "US letter fax test page" (28d29c702fdf3c16f27b33f3e32687dd82185e8b).
Similarly, the URLs hosting the malicious files have, in both campaigns, purported to be related to eFaxes.
Large amounts of data being transferred from an organization's network to an unknown web server easily raises suspicions.
However, data being transferred to a popular cloud storage service is normal.
What better way for an attacker to surreptitiously transfer large amounts of stolen data than the same way people are transferring that same data every day for legitimate reasons.
Therefore it seems logical to attempt to reuse code such as supporting frameworks between different toolsets.
The Duke group, however, appear to have taken this a step further with SeaDuke and the CloudDuke component BastionSolution, by rewriting the same code in multiple programming languages.
This has the obvious benefits of saving time and resources by providing two malware toolsets, that while similar on the inside, appear completely different on the outside.
This way, the discovery of one toolset does not immediately lead to the discovery of the second toolset.
The Duke group, long suspected of ties to the Russian state, have been running their espionage operation for an unusually long time and - especially lately - with unusual brazenness.
