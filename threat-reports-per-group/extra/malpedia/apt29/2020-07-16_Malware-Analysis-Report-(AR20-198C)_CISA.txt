The Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
This malware has been identified as WELLMAIL.
Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been identified using this malware.

This report analyzes two unique files.
The files are a variant of the WellMail implant.
The malware provides remote operator encrypted C2 sessions and the ability to dynamically run executable scripts on infected systems.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10296782-3.v1.stix.
This artifact is an ELF 64-bit file written in Go.
This file has been identified as a variant of the malware family known as WellMail.
Figure 1 - This WellMail implant contains a structure similar to the Work function contained within the WellMess implant (47cdb87c27c4e30ea3e2de620bed380d5aed591bc50c49b55fd43e106f294854), detailed within MAR-10296782.r2.v1.WHITE.
This structure parses out executable scripts from data provided via a remote operator.
In this case, the REGEX value indicates this implant will receive scripts compressed (tar files).
The malware will then decompress them before executing the embedded script.
Analysis indicates the WellMail implant is similar in design and structure to the WellMess implant -- and both accept and execute shell scripts from a remote operator.
83014ab5b3f63b0253cdab6d715f5988ac9014570fa4ab2b267c7cf9ba237d18 and 0c5ad1e8fe43583e279201cdb1046aea742bae59685e6da24e963a41df987494 attempt to connect to the IP address.
This artifact is an ELF 64-bit file written in GO language.
This file has been identified as a variant of the WellMail malware family.
The program is capable of archiving files and sending and receiving files and messages.
It is also capable of receiving and executing shell scripts on target systems.
Note: TCP port 25 is commonly used for email (SMTP), however, the malware is only using the port for secure communications, because of the likelihood that the port will be open on the router.
When the C2 is first contacted, the program collects the IP address of the victim machine and the current user and appends this data with a unique 128-bit hash.
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems.
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
