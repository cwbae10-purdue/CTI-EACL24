The Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
This malware has been identified as SOREFANG.
Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been identified using this malware.

This report analyzes three unique files.
The files are Trojan implants designed to exploit Sangfor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) virtual private network (VPN) servers.
The malware replaces the Sangfor VPN software distributed to VPN clients.
When installed, the implants provide the remote operator total control over the infected systems.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10296782-1.v1.stix.
This application is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable.
The executable exploits a vulnerability identified within Sangfor SSL VPN devices.
The vulnerability can be leveraged to gain control over systems because the VPN clients do not properly verify the integrity of software updates.
The malware exploits this vulnerability by replacing software update binaries on compromised VPN servers.
The malicious binaries are then delivered and executed on the VPN clients reporting to the infected VPN server.
During runtime, the malware immediately attempts to clear all files from the directories "\\Sangfor\\SSL\\Log\\" and "\\Sangfor\\SSL\\Dump\\”.
The malware then attempts to install itself as the file "\\Sangfor\\SSL\\SanforUPD.exe”.
This will make this binary presumably the first update executable that gets served out as application updates to targeted Sangfor VPN clients.
Next, it checks for the presence of a file named "\\Sangfor\\SSL\\.SangforUD.sum”.
The collected system information and the result of the file enumerations are stored in a buffer in system memory.
The data sent to the C2 server is encrypted utilizing a Rivest cipher 6 (RC6) cryptographic algorithm.
The key used to encrypt the outbound data is dynamically generated during each C2 session.
The RC6 key is appended to the outbound data so the remote operator will be able to decrypt the incoming data.
The RC6 key can be found within the “filename” field of the C2 outbound data.
For example, in the following example (partial) transmission the RC6 key d4908a2e47ff25c44054f8e623426243 can be utilized to decrypt the C2 data.

—End Partial C2 Transmission—
The encrypted C2 traffic is encoded with a slightly modified Base64 algorithm.
The encoded data appears to match Base64 encoded data except there are spaces in between parts of the data (0x20).
An example of this is illustrated below where the first 32-bytes of the outbound data is replaced with the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) bytes “x”.

—End Base64 Modification—
As illustrated, it appears exactly like the Base64 output of encoding the ASCII bytes “x” with the exception of the periodic spaces within the encoded data.
If the malware is able to successfully pass and receive data from its C2 server, it will then generate 32-bytes of data and record the data into a file named "\\Sangfor\\SSL\\.SangforUD.sum”.
The malware will then enter a loop in which it attempts to download payloads from its C2 server every 900000 milliseconds.
The 32-bytes of data contained with the newly created file “.SangforUD.sum” will be contained within these connections to the malware’s C2 server.
It is not known what the C2 server does with this 32-byte value, however the malware only creates this 32-byte value and writes it to the file “SangforUD.sum” once, which suggests the 32-bit value is a unique identifier for each compromised VPN server.
Each payload downloaded from the C2 server will be immediately Base64 decoded, RC6 decrypted, executed using CreateProcessW, and then copied to the system as "\\Sangfor\\SSL\\SangforUDC.exe".
In addition, the malware decrypts the following Extensible Markup Language (XML) data indicating it uses scheduled tasks to attain persistence on a target Windows system.
This data is decrypted using the RC6 algorithm with the key: 2B6233EB3E872FF78988F4A8F3F6A3BA.
Figure 1 - Screenshot of the connection to the C2 server when attempting to download an RC6 encrypted executable payload.
Note: the unique identifier is within the "_ga=" field.
Figure 2 - Screenshot of the malware querying the C2 server after conducting the initial connection.
The initial connection will pass information stolen from the target system to the C2 server, including a unique hash used as a victim system identifier.
After a successful initial connection with the C2, the malware will begin attempting to download RC6 executable payloads.

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable and is similar in design and structure to the file 65495d173e305625696051944a36a031ea94bb3a4f13034d8be740982bc4ab75.
This application is also designed to replace the update binaries served out from Sangfor SSL VPN devices.
This malware uses the hard-coded C2 IP address 103.216.221.19 to download additional payloads.

It uses the private IP address 192.168.169.103 as a C2 server.
They are only intended for use within a private context and traffic that needs to cross the Internet will need to use a different, unique address.
Comment:        These addresses can be used by anyone without any need to coordinate with IANA or an Internet registry.
The traffic from these addresses does not come from ICANN or IANA.
We are not the source of activity you may see on logs or in e-mail records.
