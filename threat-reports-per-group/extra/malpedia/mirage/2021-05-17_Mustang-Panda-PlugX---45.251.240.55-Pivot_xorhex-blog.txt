New Mustang Panda PlugX sample compared with prior Mustang Panda/RedDelta PlugX samples
On 2021-05-01 another encrypted Mustang Panda PlugX binary was uploaded to VirusTotal.
Like the other samples, this encrypted PlugX file used a 10 byte prepended XOR key (a null byte seperates the key from the encrypted contents).
10 Byte XOR Key: 0x47, 0x45, 0x48, 0x47, 0x7a, 0x67, 0x5a, 0x6e, 0x75, 0x6d
The decrypted file continues to embed shell code in the MZ header.
The video below shows the decryption process and the embedded shell code at the begining of the file.
This instance of PlugX checks for XXXXXXXX at the start of the config section.
The RedDelta varient uses ######## instead of 8 Xs.
The extracted config contains values seen in prior Mustang Panda PlugX files.
Let’s see what other sample we have that are similar.
Using data points extracted from our sample set, I filtered down the related samples based upon the ones with a matching IP addresses.
The interactive visualization below shows the related samples and any property extracted where it was used by two or more samples.IP PivotContent Loading..Click a Node to Load Details Below
We identified 40 additional PlugX samples upon expanding our pivot to include samples that also matched on these properties.
Theese samples span across both the XXXXXXXX and ######## varients.Expanded IP PivotContent Loading..Click a Node to Load Details Below
This actually encompasses all of the MustangPanda/RedDetla PlugX samples I’ve in my collection at this time.
Note: I’m still building out my collection, so overtime it will be apparent which property values are worth pivoting on and which ones are not.
