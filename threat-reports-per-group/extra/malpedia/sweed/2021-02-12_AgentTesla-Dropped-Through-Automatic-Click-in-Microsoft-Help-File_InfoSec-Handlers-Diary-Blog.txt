Attackers have plenty of resources to infect our systems.
If some files may look suspicious because the extension is less common (like .xsl files[1]), others look really safe and make the victim confident to open it.
I spotted a phishing campaign that delivers a fake invoice.
The attached file is a classic ZIP archive but it contains a .chm file: a Microsoft compiled HTML Help file[2].
The file is named "INV00620224400.chm" (sha256:af9fe480abc56cf1e1354eb243ec9f5bee9cac0d75df38249d1c64236132ceab) and has a current VT score of 27/59[3].If you open this file, you will get a normal help file (.chm extension is handled by the c:\windows\hh.exe tool).
But you will see that a Powershell window is popping up for a few seconds and disappears.
Let's have a look at the file.
You can handle .chm files with 7Zip and browse their content:
The sub-directories starting with "$" and the files starting with "#" are standard files in such files but let's have a look at the file called "sdf48df.htm".
As usual, Microsoft provides tools and file formats that are able to work with dynamic content.
This is true for help files that can embed Javascript code.
Here is the content of the .htm file:
The variable kldfdf is easy to decode (it's just a hex-encoded chunk of data):
How is the Powershell script executed?
An object shortcut is created with the parameter Item1 containing the command to execute.
The trick is to use the method Click() on the object to make it automatically executed without the user's interaction[4].
Here is the decoded Powershell new script:
This code downloads a fake picture (hxxp://hera[.
]lt/Delta2.jpg) that contains another Powershell script.
This one will drop and execute the malware on the infected system:
The first dumped file is a DLL (sha256:88774EAD57918BF293205D038402BD64FF6504D1CB1B72DBA2B50061DFE88C79).
The second one is a PE file (sha256:39ecb2d1c2a4aa01e62effc56bb27ee8d1fe34ec43e5c99ee0b138410cfa2ca9).
Both are unknown on VT.
The DLL provides the [YESS]::f77df00sd function that presumably injects the PE file into a copy of InstallUtil.exe (a tool included in the Microsoft .Net framework).
The PE file is a classic AgentTesla!
