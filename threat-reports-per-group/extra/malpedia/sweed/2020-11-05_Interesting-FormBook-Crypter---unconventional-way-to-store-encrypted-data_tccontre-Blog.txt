Cyber Security blog - Tools and Malware Analysis
This FORMBOOK CRYPTER loader contain a lot of interesting feature to bypassed sandbox, obfuscate its code and many more.
It also show a unique way to store and parse its encrypted data to execute.
It also enumerate all the process running to the machine and try to check the existence of known debugging tools process if it is exist, if yes exit the process.
For AV related process and services, it tries to create a counter how many AV product it saw in the machine max of 2 (it seems like it checks for a testing machine that contain several AV product on it).
below is the list of the process it checks related to malware analysis tools and AV product:
And also not all stored data that it will parse to its code will be decrypted, some of those stored data is designed to compute sha1 hash that will serve as the decryption key (rc4 algortihm) to decrypt another blob of code.

Nowadays it is really a common thing for a malware to have a crypter packer, obfuscation and encryption to hide its code from analyst, evade...
